<small>THE INTRUSION OF AN ACTRESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Somewhere</span> up in the gallery an usher opened a
window. Instantly a shaft of sunlight pierced the
dark interior of the theatre. It created a mote-filled
aerial avenue across a vast space and came
to an end in a balcony box.</p>

<p>As if it were part of a general theatrical scheme
it served as a search-light and brought into brilliant
relief the upper part of a child’s body. There were
blue eyes made lustrous by dark lashes; hair the
color of goldenrod, which fell forward over one
shoulder and formed a kind of radiant vehicle above
for the support of a butterfly of blue ribbon. There
were delicate red lips, slightly parted.</p>

<p>The child leaned forward in her place and rested
her elbows on the box railing. Her chin nestled in
a little crotch, formed by her two hands. She
would have resembled one of Rubens’s cherubs, if
Rubens hadn’t conceived his cherubs on quite such
a vulgar plane.</p>

<p>It was so that Baron saw her during a brief interval.
Then the window up in the gallery was
closed, and darkness reigned in the theatre again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
The child disappeared as Marguerite always disappears
before Faust has obtained more than a
seductive glimpse of her.</p>

<p>Baron wondered who she was. She was so close
to him that he could have touched her. He wondered
how she could have slipped into the box without
his seeing or hearing her. The lights had been
on when he took his seat, and at that time he had
occupied the box alone. She must have crept in
with the cautiousness of a kitten; or perhaps she
had come under cover of the noise of applause.</p>

<p>Then he forgot her. All sorts of people were
likely to come into a playhouse during a matinée
performance, he reflected.</p>

<p>Dawn was merging into day—in the play. The
purple of a make-believe sky turned to lavender,
and to pink. The long, horizontal streaks of color
faded, and in the stronger light now turned on the
stage a gypsy woman who seemed to have been sleeping
under a hedge came into view—a young creature,
who patted back a yawn which distorted her pretty
mouth. Other persons of the drama appeared.</p>

<p>Baron succumbed to the hypnotic power of the
theatre: to the beguiling illusions of the stage, with
its beautiful voices; the relaxed musicians, unobtrusively
disinterested; the dark, indistinct rows of
alert forms down in the parquet. Despite what he
was pleased to believe was a distinguished indifference
in his manner, he was passionately fond of
plays, amazingly susceptible to their appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>The act ended; light flooded the theatre. Baron’s
glance again fell upon the intruder who had come to
share his box with him. The child really might
have been mistaken for an exquisite bit of architectural
ornamentation, if she had been placed in a
niche in the big proscenium arch. Color and pose
and outline all suggested the idea. But now her
bearing changed. As she had been absorbed in the
meaning of the play, now she became equally interested
in the audience, rising in long rows from parquet
to gallery. She looked almost aggressively
from point to point, with a lack of self-consciousness
that was quite remarkable.</p>

<p>People in the audience were noticing her, too;
and Baron felt suddenly resentful at being so conspicuously
perched before hundreds of eyes, in
company with a child he knew nothing about.</p>

<p>She appeared to have scrutinized “the house” to
her satisfaction. Then she turned as if she were
slightly bored, and gazed with perfect frankness
into Baron’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Sold out,” she said, as if she were gratified.</p>

<p>Baron did not clearly grasp the fact that she was
referring to “the house.” A question as to her age
occurred to him, but this he could not answer. She
must be absurdly young—a baby; yet he noted that
she had gained command of a glance that was
almost maturely searching and complacent. She
was not the least bit agitated.</p>

<p>When, presently, she stood up on her chair to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
obtain a general view of the audience, Baron frowned.
She was really a brazen little thing, he reflected, despite
her angelic prettiness. And he had a swift
fear that she might fall. Looking at her uneasily,
he realized now that she was quite tawdrily dressed.</p>

<p>His first impression of her had been one of beauty
unmarred. (He had not seen immediately that the
blue butterfly which rode jauntily on her crown was
soiled.) Now a closer inspection discovered a fantastic
little dress which might have been designed
for a fancy ball—and it was quite old, and almost
shabby. Yet its gay colors, not wholly faded, harmonized
with some indefinable quality in the little
creature, and the whole garment derived a grace
from its wearer which really amounted to a kind of
elfish distinction.</p>

<p>She spoke again presently, and now Baron was
struck by the quality of her voice. It was rather
full for a little girl’s voice—not the affected pipe of
the average vain and pretty child. There was an
oddly frank, comrade-like quality in it.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I’ve got a notion to do?”
she inquired.</p>

<p>Baron withdrew farther within himself. “I
couldn’t possibly guess,” he responded. He shook
his head faintly, to indicate indifference. She leaned
so far over the edge of the box that he feared again
for her safety.</p>

<p>“I think you might possibly fall,” he said.
“Would you mind sitting down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>She did as he suggested with a prompt and sweet
spirit of obedience. “I’m afraid I was careless,”
she said. Then, looking over more guardedly, she
added: “I’ve got a notion to drop my programme
down on that old duck’s bald head.”</p>

<p>Baron looked down into the parquet. An elderly
gentleman, conspicuously bald-headed, sat just beneath
them. Something about the shining dome
was almost comical. Yet he turned to the child
coldly. He marvelled that he had not detected a
pert or self-conscious expression of countenance to
accompany the words she had spoken. But she
was looking into his eyes quite earnestly.</p>

<p>He turned his face away from her for an instant,
and then, with an air of having worked out a problem——</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I would,” he said.</p>

<p>“It might frighten him?” she suggested.</p>

<p>“Not that. He might not think it very polite.”</p>

<p>She looked at him studiously a little, her earnest
eyes seeming to search his soul. Then she ventured
upon a story:</p>

<p>“I got on a street-car with Miss Barry to-day,
and we sat down on a seat with a fat woman; and,
believe me, the big thing nearly squeezed the gizzard
out of me.”</p>

<p>Her eyes grew wide with excitement as she
achieved the climax. She waited for his comment.</p>

<p>His eyelids quivered slightly. He decided to pay
no more attention to her, despite her prettiness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
What language! He stared resolutely at his programme
a full minute. But he could not shake off
the influence of her steady gaze. “I think you
must be exaggerating,” he said finally, with mild
irritation.</p>

<p>“Not at all, really.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” he added impatiently, “I think
your language is—is indelicate.”</p>

<p>“Do you, indeed?” She considered this. “Of
course that’s a matter of opinion.” She abandoned
the subject and seemed to be searching his face for
a topic which might be more acceptable. “A good
many things have happened to me,” she ventured
presently. “I came within an inch of getting caught
by the curtain once.”</p>

<p>He had no idea what she meant.</p>

<p>She continued: “It was in a regular tank town
somewhere. I never pay any attention to the
names of the little towns.” Her tone clearly conveyed
the fact that she wished to get away from
controversial topics. She waited, plainly puzzled,
rather than discouraged, because she received no response.
“You know,” she elaborated, “the audiences
in the little towns don’t care much whether
it’s something legitimate, or a tambourine show with
a lot of musty jokes.”</p>

<p>Still Baron’s inclination was to make no response;
but really there was such an amazing contrast between
her innocent beauty and her gamin-like
speech that he could not easily ignore her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“I’m not sure I know the difference myself,” he
confessed.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d rather see ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’
than a lot of Honey Boys, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’d be in favor of the Honey Boys,
whoever they are, unless they are pretty bad.”</p>

<p>She looked incredulous, and then disappointed.
For an instant she turned her back on him with
resolution. He observed that she squirmed herself
into a position of dignified uprightness in her
chair.</p>

<p>After a brief interval she turned to him with renewed
hope. “Maybe you’re prejudiced against
‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’?” she ventured.</p>

<p>“Frankly, I am.”</p>

<p>“You’re not down on the legitimate, though?”</p>

<p>“I like plays—if that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p>Her forehead wrinkled. “Certainly that’s what
I mean. What did you think I meant?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, I wasn’t quite sure.”</p>

<p>She searched his eyes suspiciously; then suddenly
she dimpled. “Tell me—are you an actor?
Or aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No—assuredly not!”</p>

<p>She was genuinely embarrassed. She allowed her
face to drop into her hands, and Baron felt from
her gesture that she must be blushing though he
could see that she was not.</p>

<p>After a little she laughed weakly. “How childish
of me!” she exclaimed. “I really had no right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
to make such a mistake. But please tell me how
you happen to be up in this box?”</p>

<p>“The manager was good enough to direct an usher
to bring me here.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, I thought this box was always
given to us—to the profession, I mean. I do hope
you’ll forgive me.” She seemed prepared to withdraw
her interest from him then, as if he no longer
concerned her in any way.</p>

<p>But Baron was looking at her searchingly, almost
rudely. “Are you an—an actress?” he managed to
ask.</p>

<p>Her manner changed. For the first time Baron
detected an affectation. She looked beyond him,
out toward the chattering audience, with an absurd
assumption of weariness.</p>

<p>“I thought everybody knew me,” she said. “I’m
Bonnie May. You’ve heard of me, of course?”
and she brought her eyes back to his anxiously.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, of course,” he assented. He was uncomfortable
over the untruth—or over the fact that
he had not told it adroitly.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have talked to you so freely if I
hadn’t thought you were an actor,” she explained.
“You know we always treat one another that way.”</p>

<p>His manner softened. “I’m sure I understand,”
he assured her.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_fp8">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fp8.jpg" alt="I thought everybody knew me">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“I thought everybody knew me,” she said. “I’m
Bonnie May.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>He perceived that, despite the lightness of her
manner, she was truly ashamed of her mistake. It
seemed to him that she was regretfully slipping back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
into her own world, her own realm of thought. And
she was speedily becoming, to him, not a pert minx,
but just a lonely, friendly little child.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I know just where you are appearing
now,” he said. For the moment he could
not do less than appear to be interested in her.</p>

<p>She moved uncomfortably in her chair. “I’m
not doing anything just now,” she said. Then her
eyes brightened. “The manager skipped just when
business was picking up. We had to close our season.
Such a jay town we closed in. The people wanted
to hold our trunks!”</p>

<p>“But they didn’t?”</p>

<p>“No, we gave one more performance, so we could
square up.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t you have kept on giving performances?”</p>

<p>“Of course, you wouldn’t understand. You see,
the manager was our Simon Legree, and we couldn’t
do without him.”</p>

<p>“But that last performance——”</p>

<p>“The constable who came to hold our things said
he’d take the part of Simon Legree just once, so we
could pay our bills and get out of town. He said
there was sure to be a crowd if it was known that
he would be one of the actors. He said he’d always
wanted to be an actor, but that his parents thought
it would be sinful for him to act.”</p>

<p>“But did he know the part?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t have to. Even in the profession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
there are a lot of us who don’t know our parts half
the time. You may have noticed. The constable
said he could ‘pop a whip’ and we told him that
would do, if he would remember to say ‘You black
rascal!’ every little while. That would be to Uncle
Tom, you know. Our Uncle Tom did both parts.
That happens lots of times. With any play, I mean.
He’d say: ‘Yo’ say Ah b’longs to you, Massa Legree?
Oh, no, Massa Legree, Ah don’ b’long to you.
Yo’ may own mah body, but yo’ don’ own mah
soul.’ Saying both parts, you know.”</p>

<p>When Baron laughed at this she joined in the
merriment and even promoted it. “The constable
enjoyed it,” she said. “He said he’d like to leave
town with us and play the part all the time.”</p>

<p>“He’d got over thinking it was sinful for him to
act?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the rest of us thought his first hunch
was right. Besides, there were other difficulties.
You see, our Topsy was the manager’s wife, and she
wouldn’t play any more until she found her husband.
She wasn’t much of an artist. Anyway, we
had to quit.”</p>

<p>Baron sent a wandering glance over the theatre;
but he was thinking of neither audience nor play.
He wondered whose child this could be, and by what
chance a little creature so alert and so friendly in
her outlook upon life should be deeply submerged in
the make-believe of men, when she should have
been reading only the primer of real things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Then by chance his eyes fell upon Thornburg, the
manager, who stood just inside the foyer, engaged
in what was seemingly an intense conversation with
a tall, decidedly striking-looking woman. And even
as his eyes rested upon these two they looked up at
him as if he were the subject of their conversation.
Or were they not, more probably, discussing the
child who sat near him?</p>

<p>He had no time to pursue his reflections. The
orchestra brought to its climax the long overture
which it had been playing with almost grotesque inadequacy,
and the curtain went up on the next act.</p>

<p>There was the sudden diminuendo of voices
throughout the house, and the stealthy disturbance
of an individual here and there feeling his way to
his seat. Then again Baron was lost in the progress
of the play.</p>

<p>The child shrank into herself again and became
once more an absorbed, unobtruding little creature.</p>

<p>Baron sat in rapt silence for half an hour; and
then the master dramatist, Fate, intervened, and
proceeded to make him a figure in one of those real
dramas before which all make-believe fades into insignificance.</p>

<p>At the left of the stage a flame went leaping up
along the inner edge of one of the wings, and took
swift hold of a cloud of filmy fabric overhead. The
theatre was afire!</p>

<p>Baron saw and was incredulous. The child near
him remained undisturbed. The persons on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
stage continued their work with an evenness which,
to Baron, became suddenly a deadly monotony.
But back in those realms in the theatre which were
all but hidden from him he saw the swift movements
of men who were confronted with an unwonted, a
fearful task.</p>

<p>He turned to the child with sudden purpose, with
a manner that was harsh and peremptory. “Come!”
he said. His voice was subdued yet vibrant.</p>

<p>The child noted the vibration and quickly caught
the expression of command in his eyes. She put
out a hand toward him obediently, but he excitedly
ignored that. He gathered her into his arms and disappeared
from the box. In an instant he was carrying
her cautiously yet swiftly down a narrow stairway.</p>

<p>He skirted the wall of the theatre and passed the
manager in the foyer. He paused long enough to
whisper a few startling words, and then hurried
toward the entrance. His ears were fortified for
the screams of women; but he heard only the dull
sound of the asbestos curtain being lowered as he
passed out to the street. He did not hesitate until
he had turned a corner and was well out of the way
of a possible panic-stricken crowd.</p>

<p>He put the child down on the sidewalk; she was
really a good deal above the weight of those children
who are usually carried. A few steps and they had
reached a confectioner’s shop, in which women and
children were sitting at little tables, oblivious to all
menaces, far or near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Let’s go in here,” he said, trying to assume a
matter-of-fact tone. The child looked searchingly
into his eyes. “What was it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“What was what?”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she exclaimed with impatience. And
then she looked up and down the street, where the
constant stream of strangers passed. She felt forlorn,
alone. She turned again to Baron as to a final
refuge. “I behaved myself,” she said. “I didn’t
wait to ask what was the matter—I didn’t say a
word. But I knew something had happened. I
could hear your heart beating. I knew it was something
terrible. But you could tell me now!”</p>

<p>Baron guided her to a chair and released her
with a feeling of relief. His impulse was to take his
departure and let the incident end as it might. But
that wouldn’t do, certainly! What would the confectioner
do with the child? Besides, there was
something about her——</p>

<p>Through the fitful symphony of the city’s noises
the clang of an alarm-bell sounded.</p>

<p>The child lifted her head; her eyes became wide
with excitement. “There’s a fire!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Baron. “It’s in the theatre. I
thought we ought to come out, though of course it
may not amount to anything. We’ll wait here until
the excitement is over, and then we’ll go out
and find your——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence. He realized that
he did not know how. Instead he turned to a clerk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
and ordered something—he scarcely knew what.
He was listening to those noises out in the street;
he was noting, soon with great relief, that they were
abating rapidly. Clearly there had been no real
danger, after all.</p>

<p>He led his charge from the place presently. He
noticed that she had not touched a little dish of
something the clerk had set before her.</p>

<p>On the street again he was surprised to perceive
that the normal activities of the neighborhood had
been resumed. The audience in the theatre had
been dismissed upon some pretext of a nature not
at all terrifying. The fire had been extinguished.
The lobby was deserted. No one was searching or
waiting for a little girl, or seemed to be remotely
interested in one.</p>

<p>“Strange!” reflected Baron. He was wholly outside
the realm of make-believe now. He was amid
painfully prosaic surroundings.</p>

<p>He turned to his companion. “Er—your name
has escaped me for the minute——”</p>

<p>“Bonnie May.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Well, Bonnie May, I think I’ll have
to take you home.”</p>

<p>“Whose home—yours?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, no! To your own!”</p>

<p>She peered into the lobby searchingly, the light
slowly fading from her eyes.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t any home,” she said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>A MOMENTOUS DECISION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was all very well for a young man of an almost
painfully circumspect type to rescue a youthful
female from danger. It was a different matter,
however, when he found himself walking along a
crowded thoroughfare, leading a waif in a fantastic
and almost shabby dress, and bringing upon himself
the curious, if not the suspicious, glances of
passers-by.</p>

<p>This fact struck Baron forcibly and unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“Come, let’s get inside somewhere,” he said to
his companion. He spoke almost abjectly, as if he
had been a soldier seeking a hiding-place behind a
wall. “This place will do!” He had espied a
haven in the form of a restaurant, deserted by all
save two or three young women wearing waitresses’
aprons and caps.</p>

<p>Bonnie May looked at him inquiringly, almost
piteously. This movement was a mere strategy,
she realized. It was not a time for eating. But
the ready speech of half an hour ago had deserted
her, and she entered the restaurant, when Baron
opened the door for her, without saying a word.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Indeed she stood so forlornly and dependently that
her companion realized anew that he had somehow
committed an enormous blunder.</p>

<p>“Sit down somewhere,” he said almost impatiently;
and when he noted the childish effort with
which she wriggled into her chair, and tried heroically
to assume a debonair manner, a feeling deeper
than mere irritation seized him.</p>

<p>“Darn the luck!” he ruminated; “she’s so little,
and so lovely—what’s a fellow to do in such a case,
anyway?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem quite a suitable time to be eating,
does it?” she observed politely. The words
were accompanied by a gently deprecatory smile
which amazed Baron by a quality of odd sophistication
and practised self-restraint.</p>

<p>“We needn’t eat anything,” he said, more cordially.
“I think we ought to order something to
drink. You see, I have to decide what to do.”</p>

<p>She adjusted certain articles on the table with
feminine nicety. “That’s very good of you, I’m
sure,” she said.</p>

<p>“What is?”</p>

<p>“I mean your taking an interest in me.”</p>

<p>“An interest in you! What else can I do?”</p>

<p>She propped her face up in the palms of her
hands and looked across the table at him meditatively.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” he exclaimed. “I’m not used to having
a cherub on my hands. It’s my own predicament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
I’m thinking about, not yours. Do you drink
milk?”</p>

<p>A waitress had approached and was standing behind
them.</p>

<p>She resented his brusque manner, now that the
waitress was there to hear. “I have done such a
thing,” she said. “As a rule I’m permitted to choose
for myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, by all means do, then.”</p>

<p>She turned to the waitress and lowered her voice
by a full tone. “A cup of chocolate, please; not
too thick; and some wafers.” She faced Baron
again with a ready change of countenance and voice,
and touched upon some trivial subject which he
recognized as a formal means of dispelling any impression
that there was something unusual in their
relationship or appearance.</p>

<p>“Now, Bonnie May,” he began, when they were
alone, “I want you to help me as far as you can.
Who took you to the theatre this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I went with Miss Barry.”</p>

<p>“Good. Who is Miss Barry?”</p>

<p>“Miss Florence Barry. You don’t mean to say
you don’t know who she is?”</p>

<p>“I never heard of her.”</p>

<p>“She’s an actress. She’s very well known, too.”</p>

<p>“Very well. How did she happen to take you?
How did you happen to be with her?”</p>

<p>“I’ve always been with her. She’s all I’ve
got.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“We’re getting along nicely. You’re related to
her, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say. It’s possible.”</p>

<p>Baron frowned. “Your mother is dead?” he
asked.</p>

<p>She gazed at him with a gathering cloud in her
eyes—a look that was eloquent of secret sorrow
and beseechment. But she made no response in
words.</p>

<p>Baron felt the pangs of swift remorse. “I suppose
Miss Barry will have to do,” he said, with an
attempt at kindly brusqueness. Then—“Can you
tell me her address?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose she has any. We’ve been doing
one-night stands quite a long time.”</p>

<p>“But she must belong some place—and you, too.
Where have you been stopping?”</p>

<p>“We only got here yesterday. I see you don’t
quite understand. We’ve just been moving from
place to place all the time.”</p>

<p>Baron pondered. “Have you always lived in
hotels, in one town or another?” he finally asked.</p>

<p>“Hotels—and theatres and rooming-houses, and
trains and even wagons and carriages. Every kind
of place.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, where did you stop last night?”</p>

<p>“We had a room somewhere. I really couldn’t
tell you where. It was the meanest kind of a place—empty
and cold—quite a distance from the
theatre. It was in a long row of houses, built one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
up against another, miles and miles long, with
cheap, little old stores or shops down-stairs, and
sometimes rooms above that you could rent. We
were just getting ready to look for an engagement,
you know, and we were broke. We couldn’t afford
to go to a nice place.”</p>

<p>The fine show of bravery was beginning to pass.
She felt that she was being questioned unsympathetically.</p>

<p>Baron, too, realized that his questions must seem
to lack friendliness.</p>

<p>The waiter brought chocolate and coffee, and
Baron dropped sugar into his cup, thoughtfully
watching the little bubbles that arose. Then,
much to Bonnie May’s surprise, and not a little to
her relief, he laughed softly.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, I’m sure,” was Bonnie
May’s chilling rejoinder. She began to sip her
chocolate with impressive elegance.</p>

<p>“Why not?” reflected Baron. He was drawing
a picture of Bonnie May in his mother’s presence—his
mother, who was the most punctilious of all
elderly ladies, and whose genuine goodness of heart
was usually quite concealed by the studied way in
which she adhered to the unbending social codes
that must govern a Baron—or, rather, a Boone.
She was a Boone—of the Virginia Boones—when
she married Baron’s father; a beauty who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
been wealthy, despite the disintegration of the
Boone fortunes when the Civil War freed the
slaves.</p>

<p>He pictured Bonnie May in the dim old mansion
that was his home—in that aged house that never
knew the voices of children; in which even adults
seemed always to be speaking in low, measured
tones.</p>

<p>“The governess isn’t as bad as she would like
to appear,” was his irreverent meditation, which
still related to his mother. “And Flora would take
my part. As for the governor——”</p>

<p>He turned to the child with decision. He realized,
finally, that the question of treating her
just as if she were any other lost child was not to
be considered.</p>

<p>“Bonnie May,” he said, “I think you’d better
go home with me for the time being. We can
put something in the paper, you know, and I’ll
find out if Miss Barry has left any word with the
police. But that can’t be done in a minute, and of
course we can’t sit here all afternoon. Come, let’s
go home.”</p>

<p>The waitress came forward to assist when she
saw Bonnie May trying to climb down from her
chair without loss of dignity.</p>

<p>“It was very nice,” said the child, addressing
the waitress. She was smiling angelically. “I
think we’re ready,” she added, turning toward
Baron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>She tried to catch step with him as they moved
toward the door.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And Baron could not possibly have known that
at that very moment his mother and his sister
Flora were sitting in an upper room of the mansion,
brooding upon the evil days that had fallen upon
the family fortunes.</p>

<p>Theirs was a very stately and admirable home—viewed
from within. But it was practically all
that the family possessed, and the neighborhood—well,
the neighborhood had wholly lost eligibility
as a place for residences long ago.</p>

<p>All their friends, who had formerly been their
neighbors, had moved away, one after another,
when commerce had descended upon the street,
with its grime and smoke, and only the Barons remained.
Certainly cities grow without any regard
at all for the dignity of old mansions or old families.</p>

<p>And while the ground on which the mansion
stood had increased in value until it was worth a
considerable fortune, it was a carefully guarded
family secret that the actual supply of funds in the
family treasury had dwindled down to next to
nothing.</p>

<p>One permanent investment brought Mrs. Baron
a few hundreds annually, and Mr. Baron drew
a modest salary from a position with the city,
which he had held many years without complaint
or lapses. But the fortune that used to be theirs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
had vanished mysteriously in trips to Europe and
in the keeping up of those social obligations which
they could not disregard. The formal social activities
of the mansion had become wholly things
of the past, and within the past year or two the
visits of old friends, now living out in commodious
new residential districts, had become few and far
between. Really it seemed that the Barons had
been forgotten.</p>

<p>Flora, looking suddenly into her mother’s brooding,
fine old eyes, and quite accurately reading the
thought that was beyond them, sighed and arose.</p>

<p>“It’s the neighborhood,” she said—quite ambiguously,
it would have seemed, since not a word
had passed between them for nearly half an hour.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Baron responded: “Do you think so?”
And her face stiffened with new resolve not to repine,
even if the currents of life had drawn away
from them and left them desolate.</p>

<p>Then an automobile drew up in front of the
mansion and Flora’s face brightened. “They’ve
come!” she said. “I won’t be gone long, mother,”
and she hurried away to her room.</p>

<p>A moment later Mrs. Baron heard her going
down the stairs and closing the front door.</p>

<p>She stood at the window and watched Flora get
into the shining electric coupé of the McKelvey
girls. She caught a glimpse of the McKelvey
girls’ animated faces, and then the elegant little
vehicle moved away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Still she stood at the window. Her face was
rather proud and defiant. And then after a time
it became, suddenly, quite blank.</p>

<p>There was Victor coming up the stone steps into
the yard, and he was leading a waif by the hand.
Only the word “waif” did not occur to Mrs.
Baron.</p>

<p>“Well!” she exclaimed, her body rigid, her eyes
staring out from beneath pugnacious brows. “Victor
and an impossible little female!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>MRS. BARON DECIDES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Baron felt for his key he stood an instant and
surveyed the other side of the street, up and down
the block. A frown gathered on his forehead.</p>

<p>Bonnie May, keyed to a very high pitch, noted
that frowning survey of the line of buildings across
the way. “Something wrong?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, certainly not,” responded Baron; but to
himself he was admitting that there was something
very wrong indeed. It was the neighborhood.
This was his conclusion, just as it had been
Flora’s.</p>

<p>He had become conscious of the frowning, grimy
fronts; the windows which were like eyes turning
baleful glances upon the thoroughfare. The grass-plots,
the flower-beds, the suitable carpets spread
for the feet of spring—what had become of them?</p>

<p>A dissolute-appearing old woman was scrubbing
the ancient stone steps in one place across the way.
She suggested better days just as obviously as did
the stones, worn away by generations of feet. And
a little farther along there were glaring plate-glass
fronts bearing gilt legends which fairly
shrieked those commercial words—which ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
have been whispered from side doors, Baron
thought—Shoes, and Cloaks, and Hats.</p>

<p>What sort of a vicinity was this in which to
have a home?</p>

<p>Baron wondered why the question had not occurred
to him before. He did not realize that he
was viewing the street now for the first time through
the eyes of a child who owed the neighborhood no
sort of sentimental loyalty.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” he exclaimed as he produced his
key; but his tone was by no means as cheerful as he
tried to make it.</p>

<p>Bonnie May hung back an instant, as a butterfly
might pause at the entrance of a dark wood. She
glanced into the dark vestibule before her inquiringly.
Her eyebrows were critically elevated.</p>

<p>“Is it a—a rooming-house?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! It’s always been called a mansion.
It’s a charming old place, too—I assure you!
Come, we ought not to stand here.”</p>

<p>He was irritated. More so than he had been
before when his companion’s look or word had
served as a reminder that he was doing an extraordinary,
if not a foolish, thing. He would not
have admitted it, but he was nervous, too. His
mother hadn’t been at all amiable of late. There
wasn’t any telling what she would do when he
said to her, in effect: “Here’s a lost child. I don’t
know anything at all about her, but I expect you
to help her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Suppose she should decide to express her frank
opinion of waifs, and of people who brought them
home?</p>

<p>He fumbled a little as he unlocked the door.
His heart was fairly pounding.</p>

<p>“There you are!” he exclaimed. His voice was
as gayly hospitable as he could make it, but his
secret thought was: “If she weren’t so—so—Oh,
darn it, if she were like any other child I’d
shut her out this minute and let that be the end
of it.”</p>

<p>The hall was shadowy; yet even in the dim light
Baron perceived that the marble balustrade of the
stairway was strangely cold and unattractive—and
he had always considered this one of the fine things
about the house. So, too, was the drawing-room
gloomy almost to darkness. The blinds were down
as always, save on special occasions. And Baron
realized that the family had long ago ceased to
care about looking out upon the street, or to permit
the street to get a glimpse of the life within.
Indeed, he realized with a bit of a shock that the
home life had been almost entirely removed to the
upper floor—as if the premises were being submerged
by a flood.</p>

<p>He lifted one of the blinds. “Sit down,” he said.
“I’ll find mother.”</p>

<p>“What do you use this room for?” inquired
Bonnie May. She was slightly pale. She seemed
to be fortifying herself for weird developments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“I hardly know,” Baron confessed. “I think
we don’t use it very much at all.”</p>

<p>“You might think from the properties that it
was a rooming-house.” She had wriggled into a
chair that was too high for her. Her curiosity was
unconcealed. Baron could see by the look in her
eyes that she had not meant her comment to be
derisive, but only a statement of fact.</p>

<p>“Possibly you haven’t seen many quite old,
thoroughly established homes,” he suggested. The
remark wasn’t meant at all as a rebuke. It represented
the attitude of mind with which Baron had
always been familiar.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” she persisted, “it wouldn’t do for
an up-to-date interior. It might do for an Ibsen
play.”</p>

<p>Baron, about to leave the room to find his
mother, turned sharply. “What in the world do
you know about Ibsen plays?” he asked sharply.
“Besides, you’re not in a theatre! If you’ll excuse
me a minute——”</p>

<p>There were footsteps on the stairway, and Baron’s
countenance underwent a swift change. He withdrew
a little way into the room, so that he stood
close to Bonnie May. He was trying to look conciliatory
when his mother appeared in the doorway;
but guilt was really the expression that was
stamped on his face.</p>

<p>It was a very austere-looking old lady who
looked into the room. “Good evening,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
as if she were addressing strangers. Still, Baron
detected a wryly humorous smile on her lips. She
stood quite still, critically inspecting her son as
well as his companion.</p>

<p>Baron was glad that Bonnie May sprang to her
feet instantly with comprehension and respect.
“This is my mother, Mrs. Baron,” he said to the
child; and to the quizzical old lady, who regarded
him with a steady question, he added foolishly,
“this is a little girl I have brought home.”</p>

<p>“So I should have surmised.” Her tone was
hardening. Her attitude was fearfully unyielding.
It seemed to Baron that her gray hair, which rose
high and free from her forehead, had never imparted
so much severity to her features before, and
that her black eyes had never seemed so imperious.</p>

<p>But Bonnie May was advancing very prettily.
“How do you do, Mrs. Baron?” she inquired.
She was smiling almost radiantly. “I do hope I
don’t intrude,” she added.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron looked down at her with frank amazement.
For the moment she forgot the presence of
her son. She took the child’s outstretched hand.</p>

<p>Perhaps the touch of a child’s fingers to a woman
who has had children but who has them no longer
is magical. Perhaps Bonnie May was quite as extraordinary
as Victor Baron had thought her. At
any rate, Mrs. Baron’s face suddenly softened.
She drew the child into the protection of her arm
and held her close, looking at her son.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“Good evening,” she said, as if she were addressing strangers.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Who in the world is she?” she asked, and
Baron saw that her eyes were touched with a light
which was quite unfamiliar to him.</p>

<p>“I was going to tell you,” he faltered, and then
he remembered that there was practically nothing
he could tell. He saved time by suggesting: “Perhaps
she could go up-stairs a minute, while I talk
to you alone?”</p>

<p>“Would it be wrong for me to hear?” This was
from the child. “You know I might throw a little
light on the subject myself.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron blushed rosily and placed her hand
over her mouth, wrenching a swift smile therefrom.
She had heard of precocious children. She disapproved
of them. Neither of her own children had
been in the least precocious. “Who ever heard
anything like that?” she demanded of her son in
frank amazement.</p>

<p>“There are some things I ought to say to my
mother alone,” declared Baron. He placed a persuasive
hand on the child’s shoulder. “Afterward
you can talk the matter over together.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron’s doubts were returning. “I don’t
see why we should make any mysteries,” she said.
She looked at the child again, and again all her
defenses were laid low. “I suppose she might go
up-stairs to my sitting-room, if there’s anything
to say. Tell me, child,” and she bent quite graciously
over the small guest, “what is your name?”</p>

<p>“I am Bonnie May,” was the response. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
child was inordinately proud of her name, but she
did not wish to be vainglorious now. She lowered
her eyes with an obviously theatrical effect, assuming
a nice modesty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron observed sharply, and nodded her
head.</p>

<p>“That’s a queer name for a human being,” was
her comment. She looked at her son as if she suddenly
had a bad taste in her mouth. “It sounds
like a doll-baby’s name.”</p>

<p>The child was shocked by the unfriendliness—the
rudeness—of this. Mrs. Baron followed up
her words with more disparagement in the way of
a steady, disapproving look. Precocious children
ought to be snubbed, she thought.</p>

<p>The good lady would not have offended one of
her own age without a better reason; but so many
good people do not greatly mind offending a child.</p>

<p>“You know,” said Bonnie May, “I really didn’t
have anything to do with picking out my own
name. Somebody else did it for me. And maybe
they decided on it because they thought it would
look good on the four-sheets.”</p>

<p>“On the——”</p>

<p>But Baron swiftly interposed.</p>

<p>“We can go into matters of that sort some other
time,” he said. “I think it would be better for
you to leave mother and me alone for a minute
just now.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May went out of the room in response<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
to Baron’s gesture. “I’ll show you the way,” he
said, and as he began to guide her up the stairs
she turned toward him, glancing cautiously over his
shoulder to the room they had just quitted.</p>

<p>“Believe me,” she whispered, “that’s the first
time I’ve had stage fright in years.” She mounted
three or four steps and then paused again. “You
know,” she confided, turning again, “she makes
you think of a kind of honest sister to Lady Macbeth.”</p>

<p>Baron stopped short, his hand on the balustrade.
“Bonnie May,” he demanded, “will you tell me
how old you are?”</p>

<p>He had a sudden fear that she was one of those
pitiable creatures whose minds grow old but whose
bodies remain the same from year to year.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she replied, instantly troubled.
“Miss Barry never would tell me.”</p>

<p>“Well, how far back can you remember?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite a long time. I know I had a real
speaking part as long as four seasons ago. I’ve
been doing little Eva off and on over two years.”</p>

<p>He was greatly relieved. “It seems to me,” he
said severely, “that you know about plays which
a little girl ought not to know anything about.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, I was with Miss Barry in lots of plays
that I didn’t have any part in, unless it might be
to help out with the populace, or something like
that. And we did stock work for a while, with a
new play every week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Somehow this speech had the effect of restoring
her to favor with Baron. Her offenses were clearly
unconscious, unintended, while her alertness, her
discernment, were very genuine and native. What
a real human being she was, after all, despite her
training in the unrealities of life! And how quick
she was to see when she had offended, and how
ready with contrition and apology! Surely that
was the sort of thing that made for good breeding—even
from the standpoint of a Baron or a Boone!</p>

<p>They traversed the upper hall until they reached
an immense front room which was filled with the
mellow sunlight of the late afternoon, and which
was invitingly informal and untidy in all its aspects.
It was one of those rooms which seem alive, because
of many things which speak eloquently of recent
occupation and of the certainty of their being occupied
immediately again.</p>

<p>A square piano, pearl inlaid and venerable, caught
Bonnie May’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” she exclaimed. She stood a
moment, pressing her hands to her cheeks. “Yes,”
she added musingly, “I can actually see them.”</p>

<p>“See whom?” Baron demanded, slightly impatient.</p>

<p>“The nice, sweet girls, wearing crinoline, and
dancing with their arms around one another’s
waists, and one of them sitting at the piano playing,
and looking over her shoulder at the others.
There are tender smiles on their lips, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
eyes are shining like anything. They are so dear
and happy!”</p>

<p>Baron frowned. Why should the child associate
the house, his home, only with things so remote
with respect to time and place? It was a jealously
guarded family secret that life was relentlessly
passing on, leaving them stranded in old ways.
But was a child—a waif picked up in pity, or in a
spirit of adventure—to wrest the secret from among
hidden things and flaunt it in his face?</p>

<p>She had gone into the big bay window and was
standing with one hand on the long willow seat,
covered with pale-hued cushions. For the moment
she was looking down upon the bit of grass-plot
below.</p>

<p>“Make yourself at home,” invited Baron. “I
won’t be long.”</p>

<p>He went back to his mother. He wished she
might have heard what the child had said about
the girls who were dancing, far away in the past.</p>

<p>“Well, who is she?” was Mrs. Baron’s abrupt,
matter-of-fact question.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. That’s the plain truth. I’m
thinking more about <i>what</i> she is—or what she seems
to be.”</p>

<p>He described the incident in the theatre, and
explained how he had been in fear of a panic. “I
felt obliged to carry her out,” he concluded rather
lamely.</p>

<p>“I quite see that. But that didn’t make you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
responsible for her in any way,” Mrs. Baron reminded
him.</p>

<p>“Well now, governess, do be friendly. I’m not
responsible for her—I know that. But you see,
she appears to be alone in the world, except for a
Miss Barry, an actress. I couldn’t find her. Of
course she’ll be located to-morrow. That’s all
there is to it. And let’s not be so awfully particular.
There can’t be any harm in having the little thing
in the house overnight. Honestly, don’t you think
she is wonderful?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron was diligently nursing her wrath.
“That isn’t the question,” she argued. “I dare
say a good many unidentified children are wonderful.
But that would scarcely justify us in turning
our house into an orphan asylum.”</p>

<p>“Oh! An orphan asylum!” echoed Baron almost
despairingly. “Look here, mother, it was
just by chance that I ran across the little thing,
and under the circumstances what was I going to
do with her?”</p>

<p>“There were the police, at least.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought of that.”</p>

<p>He went to the window and stood with his back
to her. For a full minute there was silence in the
room, and then Baron spoke. He did not turn
around.</p>

<p>“Yes, there were the police,” he repeated, “but
I couldn’t help remembering that there was also
I—and we. I had an idea we could do a good deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
better than the police, in a case like this. I don’t
understand how women feel, mother, but I can’t
help remembering that every little girl is going to
be a woman some day. And I’ve no doubt that the
kind of woman she is going to be will be governed
a good deal by seemingly trivial events. I don’t
see why it isn’t likely that Bonnie May’s whole
future may depend upon the way things fall out
for her now, when she’s really helpless and alone
for the first time in her life. I think it’s likely she’ll
remember to the end of her days that people were
kind to her—or that they weren’t. We’ve nothing
to be afraid of at the hands of a little bit of a girl.
At the most, we’ll have to give her a bed for the
night and a bite to eat and just a little friendliness.
It’s she who must be afraid of us!—afraid that
we’ll be thoughtless, or snobbish, and refuse to give
her the comfort she needs, now that she’s in
trouble.”</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>“A speech!” exclaimed Mrs. Baron, and Baron
could not fail to note the irony in her voice. She
added, in the same tone: “The haughty mother
yields to the impassioned plea of her noble son!”</p>

<p>Baron turned and observed that she was smiling
rather maliciously.</p>

<p>“You’d better go up and look after her,” she
added. “Flora will be home before long.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A CRISIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> five o’clock, during a brief lull in the usual
noises on the avenue, there was a faint and aristocratic
murmur of machinery in front of the mansion.
The McKelvey girls’ motor-car drew up at
the curb, and Miss Flora Baron alighted.</p>

<p>The Misses McKelvey had come for her early in
the afternoon and had driven her out to their suburban
home, where she was always treated almost
like one of the family.</p>

<p>She was the sort of girl that people love unquestioningly:
gentle, low-voiced, seemingly happy,
grateful, gracious. Besides, there was a social kinship
between the two families. Mrs. McKelvey
had been a Miss Van Sant before her marriage,
and the Van Sants and the Boones had been neighbors
for a century or more.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Flora,” called the McKelvey girls
almost in one voice, as their guest hurried toward
her gate. Their cheerful faces were framed by the
open door of their shining coupé. And Flora looked
back over her shoulder and responded gayly, and
then hurried up into the vestibule of the mansion.</p>

<p>She carried an armful of roses which the McKelveys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
had insisted upon her bringing home: roses
with long stems, from which many of the green,
wax-like leaves had not been removed.</p>

<p>When she entered the hall she paused and sighed.
Now that her friends could not see her any longer,
she abandoned a certain gladsome bearing. It was
so lovely out at the McKelveys’, and it was so—so
different, here at home. She had the feeling one
might have upon entering a dungeon.</p>

<p>The fingers of her right hand closed upon the
dull-green-and-silver tailored skirt she was wearing,
and one foot was already planted on the first step
of the stairway. She meant to offer the roses to
her mother, who would be in the sitting-room up-stairs.</p>

<p>But before she had mounted to the second step
she heard her brother Victor’s voice in the dining-room,
and she knew by his manner of speaking that
he was at the telephone.</p>

<p>This circumstance in itself was not remarkable,
but he was asking for police headquarters!</p>

<p>Visions of a burglary passed before her mind,
and she wondered whimsically what anybody could
find in the house worth stealing. Her brother’s
next words reached her clearly:</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t say just how old she is. Say
about ten. Somebody must have reported that
she is lost.... Well, that certainly seems
strange....”</p>

<p>Flora changed her mind about going up-stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
immediately. Instead, she turned toward the
dining-room. Victor was continuing his message:
“Are you sure such a report hasn’t been made at
one of the substations?” And after a brief interval
there was the sound of the receiver being hung
up.</p>

<p>However, when Flora entered the dining-room
her brother was speaking at the telephone again.
More about a little girl. “Mr. Thornburg’s office?
Mr. Thornburg? This is Baron speaking. Say—has
anybody spoken to you about losing a little
girl this afternoon?”</p>

<p>Flora perceived that he was deeply concerned;
his attitude was even strikingly purposeful—and
Victor usually appeared to have no definite purposes
at all.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he continued, clearly in answer to words
from the other end of the wire, “I brought her
home with me. I didn’t know what else to do. I
thought somebody might have inquired at the
theatre about her. If they do, you’ll let me know
right away, won’t you? She’ll probably be with
us here until she’s claimed.”</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver. His eyes were unusually
bright.</p>

<p>“Here? Who?” demanded Flora.</p>

<p>Baron beamed upon her. “Flora!” he cried.
“I’m glad you’ve come. Something has happened!”</p>

<p>“Who’s here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“The renowned actress, Bonnie May.”</p>

<p>“Please tell me!” she begged, as if he had made
no response at all.</p>

<p>“A little lost girl.” Then Baron briefly explained.</p>

<p>Miss Baron’s eyes fairly danced. “What an adventure!”
She added presently: “Is she—nice?”</p>

<p>“Nice? That’s a woman’s first question every
time, isn’t it?” Baron reflected. “I suppose so.
I know she’s pretty—the very prettiest thing!”</p>

<p>“And that’s a man’s first consideration, of course.
What did mother say?”</p>

<p>“Mother is—resigned.” They moved toward
the stairway. “Try to persuade mother that a
child doesn’t count,” Baron urged. “I’m sure
Mrs. Grundy never had any children. None like
Bonnie May, anyway. When you’ve once seen
her——”</p>

<p>They were ascending the stairway eagerly, whispering.
A dozen years at least seemed to have
slipped from their shoulders. They entered Mrs.
Baron’s sitting-room quite eagerly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron and Bonnie May were sitting quite
close together, the guest in a low chair that was
Flora’s. Mrs. Baron was maintaining the rôle of
indulgent but overridden oracle; Bonnie May was
amiably inclined to make allowances. They were
conversing in a rather sedate fashion.</p>

<p>“My sister, Flora, Bonnie May,” said Baron.</p>

<p>The child came forward eagerly. “How lovely!”
she exclaimed, extending her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Flora regarded the child with smiling eyes. “Oh!
you mean the roses,” she said. “Yes, they are.”
But she did not look at the flowers on her arm.
She pushed a pennon-like fragment of veil away
from her face and smiled quietly at the child.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean them,” explained Bonnie May.
“I meant it was lovely that you should be—that
I’m to have— Do excuse me, I mean that <i>you</i>
are lovely!”</p>

<p>Only an instant longer Miss Baron remained as
if happily spellbound. A breath that was fragrant
and cool emanated from her and her roses. The
hue of pleasure slowly deepened in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“You dear child!” she said at last, the spell
broken, “I can’t remember when anybody has
said such a thing to me before.”</p>

<p>She laid the roses in her mother’s lap. “And
to think we’re to keep her!” she added.</p>

<p>“Overnight,” Mrs. Baron made haste to say.
“Yes, she is to be our guest until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But nobody has inquired for her,” said Flora.
“Victor’s been telephoning. The police and the
people at the theatre——”</p>

<p>“Where did you get such beautiful roses?” inquired
Mrs. Baron, wholly by way of interruption.
The arch of her eyebrows was as a weather-signal
which Flora never disregarded. She changed the
subject. She had much to say about her ride.
But her eyes kept straying back to Bonnie May,
who remained silent, her body leaning slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
forward, her head pitched back, her eyes devouring
Miss Baron’s face. The attitude was so touchingly
childlike that Flora had visions of herself
in a big rocking-chair, putting the little thing to
sleep, or telling her stories. “Only until to-morrow,”
her mother had said, but no one was asking for the
child anywhere. Of course she would stay until—until——</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said absent-mindedly, in response to
a question by her mother, “they brought me home
in their car. They were so lovely to me!” Her
eyes strayed back to Bonnie May, whose rapt
gaze was fixed upon her. The child flushed and
smiled angelically.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If any constraint was felt during the dinner-hour,
Bonnie May was evidently less affected than
the others at table.</p>

<p>The one test which might have been regarded
as a critical one—the appearance of the head of
the household—was easily met.</p>

<p>Mr. Baron came home a little late and immediately
disappeared to dress for dinner. Bonnie
May did not get even a glimpse of him until the
family took their places at table.</p>

<p>“Hello! Who said there weren’t any more
fairies?” was his cheerful greeting, as he stood an
instant beside his chair before he sat down. He
was a tall, distinguished-looking man with a pointed
gray beard, which seemed always to have been of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
its present color, rather than to suggest venerableness.
He had piercing gray eyes, which seemed
formidable under their definite black eyebrows.
However, his eyes readily yielded to a twinkle
when he smiled. He still adhered rigidly to the custom
of dressing formally for dinner, and he entertained
a suspicion that Victor’s vocation, which
consisted of literary work of some indefinite kind,
was making him sadly Bohemian, since his son did
not perceive the need of being so punctilious. “It’s
not as if we had company often,” was Victor’s defense,
on one occasion, of the course he had adopted;
but his father’s retort had been that “they were
still in the habit of dining with one another.”</p>

<p>“A little girl we are sheltering to-night,” was
Mrs. Baron’s explanation to her husband, who still
regarded the child at the opposite end of the table.</p>

<p>“I am Bonnie May,” amended the child. “I
am very glad to meet you, I’m sure.” She smiled
graciously and nodded with such dignity as was
compatible with a rather difficult position. She
was occupying an “adult” chair, and little more
than her head and shoulders was visible. She had
briefly yet firmly discouraged the suggestion that
she sit on a book.</p>

<p>“A—protégée of Victor’s,” added Mrs. Baron,
with the amiable malice which the family easily
recognized.</p>

<p>But Flora noted the word “protégée” and smiled.
To her mind it suggested permanency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“A very fine little girl, I’m sure,” was Mr. Baron’s
comment. He was critically looking at the fowl
which Mrs. Shepard, housekeeper and woman of
all work, had placed before him. His entire attention
was immediately monopolized by the carving
implements. He appeared to forget the child’s
presence.</p>

<p>This fact is set down as a significant one, because
Flora and Baron, Jr., were both keenly and frankly
interested in his impression. If he didn’t mind
having her about, another point in her favor would
have been gained. Mrs. Baron, too, was covertly
interested in his attitude. She was not quite sure
whether she wished him to confirm her fears or
to share her son’s and daughter’s faith in the unexpected
guest.</p>

<p>Thereafter the meal progressed somewhat silently.
Every individual in the group was alertly awaiting
developments.</p>

<p>“Children always like the drumstick,” declared
Mr. Baron genially, looking at Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so,” admitted the guest politely.
She added casually: “I usually prefer the wing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baron rested the carving knife and fork on
his plate and scrutinized the speaker sharply.
The child was opening her napkin with a kind of
elegant deliberation.</p>

<p>Then he smiled. “A wing it shall be,” he declared.</p>

<p>Later Mrs. Baron took occasion to assert her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
authority. “Children should not stare,” she declared,
trying to assume a severe contralto tone,
but taking care to smile, so that her rebuke would
seem to have been kindly offered.</p>

<p>Indeed, Bonnie May was paying less attention
to her dinner than to the exquisite napery, the
cut-glass vase in which some of Flora’s roses had
been placed, the dinner-set of chaste design, and
to the countenances about her.</p>

<p>“Quite true,” she admitted, in response to Mrs.
Baron. “But you know, when you get into a new
company, it’s quite natural to size everybody up,
so you can make up your mind what to expect of
them.”</p>

<p>She took a very small bite from a young green
onion, holding her little finger elegantly apart.
“How prettily the white blends with the green,”
she said approvingly, looking critically at the
onion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron flushed. “My remark was that children
ought not to stare,” she repeated persistently
and less gently.</p>

<p>The child’s serenity failed her. “I don’t, usually,”
she said in painful embarrassment, “and I don’t
believe I criticise people’s manners, either, unless
it’s in private.”</p>

<p>She regained her self-control immediately. She
replaced the onion on her plate and lifted her napkin
to her lips with exquisite care.</p>

<p>The adult persons at the table were all looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
from one to another. There were horizontal lines
in every forehead.</p>

<p>“I can’t remember having been anywhere where
the service was so admirable,” the guest added,
directing her glance toward her own section of
the board. There was a suggestion of gentle ennui
in her tone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron was glaring at her, her face aflame
with mortification. It was a countenance the family
was familiar with.</p>

<p>“Well, what have you been doing to-day, Victor?”
inquired Mr. Baron jocosely.</p>

<p>It was the tone—and the tactics—he always
adopted when he wished to avoid a crisis.</p>

<p>And during the remainder of the meal, Bonnie
May was an extraordinarily circumspect and silent
little girl.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>BONNIE MAY OPENS THE DOOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a polite, somewhat nervous exchange
of remarks at the table during the remainder of
the dinner-hour. It was the kind of conversation
that is employed sometimes not only to conceal
thought, but to divert attention from the fact that
there is anything to think about.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, every member of the family was
thinking hard—and uncomfortably.</p>

<p>Baron, Sr., was trying patiently to determine
what subtle thing had gone wrong. Mrs. Baron,
he knew, was not disagreeable without at least
an imaginary cause.</p>

<p>Victor and Flora were thinking along somewhat
similar lines. Why had their mother deliberately
offended an inoffending guest? They knew their
guest was readily to be classified as a “precocious”
child, and Mrs. Baron had always manifested a
strong dislike—almost a dread—of precocious children,
whose remarks are sometimes so disconcerting
to those who are not very liberal-minded.</p>

<p>But it was not at all likely that Bonnie May
would remain a member of the household longer
than a day or so. Indeed, it seemed quite probable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
that she would be called for at any moment.
Such a child would not be permitted by relatives
or guardians to go begging.</p>

<p>Yet Mrs. Baron’s conduct might have been accepted
as that of one who begins the tutelage of an
adopted daughter. Had their mother jumped to
the conclusion that Bonnie May had come to live
with them permanently, and was she willing to
contemplate such an arrangement?</p>

<p>Beneath their small talk, therefore, they were
indulging in decidedly wild hopes and fancies.</p>

<p>When the family were about to leave the table,
Mrs. Baron called the housekeeper. The others
appeared not to notice particularly, but secretly
they were all attention.</p>

<p>Said Mrs. Baron:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Shepard, this little girl’s name is Bonnie
May. She is to stay with us this evening. Will
you see that the spare room in the attic is made
ready? and if you can add to her comfort in any
way, I’m sure you will.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” said Mrs. Shepard. The good,
simple creature was trying to hide her amazement.
The child had been a guest at the table—and she
was to be put up in the attic to sleep! The attic
was really a third floor; but it was used mainly
for storing things, and for the houseman’s quarters.
She regarded Bonnie May briefly—and her eyes
twinkled! The child was smiling at her amiably.</p>

<p>“Mother!” was Flora’s hesitating remonstrance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and Victor paid such studious heed to the folding
of his napkin that it was evident he was trying to
hide his discomfort. In a moment he spoke—quite
casually: “I’m afraid it will be lonesome up there
for her, mother. Suppose you let her have my
room to-night. I won’t mind giving it up.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! There’s no need of your being disturbed.”
Mrs. Baron’s forehead was still creased
by menacing horizontal lines.</p>

<p>The guest interposed. The family was rising,
and she stood with her back to the table. “If
you don’t mind, Mrs. Baron,” she said evenly,
“I’ll go back and make friends with Mrs. Shepard.
You know I dearly love the people who take the—the
character parts. They’re usually so comfortable!”</p>

<p>“Well, run along.” She tried not to speak impatiently.
She felt that there was general disapproval
of her mood.</p>

<p>The guest went into the kitchen. At the door
she turned. “It was a lovely dinner,” she said
politely. Then she disappeared.</p>

<p>Silence followed, and the family dispersed. Mr.
Baron was going out somewhere. Victor strolled
musingly up into the library. Flora followed her
mother up into the sitting-room. There was a
good deal of mental tension, considering the very
slight foundation for it.</p>

<p>In the kitchen Bonnie May’s glad bearing vanished.
She became strangely pensive for a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
girl. Mrs. Baron did not like her! That was evident.
Yet what had she done, save to take her
own part, as she had always had to do?</p>

<p>Mrs. Shepard did not realize that the child was
troubled. When children were troubled, according
to Mrs. Shepard’s experience, their lips trembled
or their eyes filled with tears. There were no such
signs to be read in Bonnie May’s face. She was
standing there in that dazed fashion because she
was in a strange place, of course.</p>

<p>“Wait until my work’s done and I’ll bake you a
little cake!” said Mrs. Shepard. She was delighted
with the idea. It occurred to her that it would be
a great pleasure to bake a little cake for the child.</p>

<p>“A little cake?” responded Bonnie May dubiously.
“It’s kind of you, you know, but really
I’ve just dined.” She put all troubled thoughts
away from her. The kitchen was really a wonderful
place. She examined various utensils with interest.
They had all been <i>used</i>. She had seen
many of these things before, but they had always
been shiny and new. The property-man had taken
care of them.</p>

<p>A little bell above Mrs. Shepard’s head tinkled
energetically. The housekeeper sighed heavily and
began wiping her hands hastily.</p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“The front-door bell,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Oh! how interesting. Let me answer it—do!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>And before Mrs. Shepard could carefully consider
the matter, she gave a reluctant consent. She
would have explained what one should do under
certain contingencies, but there hadn’t been time.
Bonnie May was gone.</p>

<p>As the child passed through the hall she heard
the family moving about up-stairs. Their voices
seemed quite remote; they were almost inaudible.
Bonnie May thought it quite probable that they
had not heard the summons at the door.</p>

<p>She felt a new kind of elation at being permitted
to officiate in even a very small domestic function.
She was going to admit some one who really came
from out of the unknown—whose every word
and movement would not be known to her beforehand.</p>

<p>Then the mansion seemed to become strangely
silent, as if it were listening uneasily to learn who
it was that had come out of the darkness and
sounded a summons to those within.</p>

<p>Bonnie May caught her breath. Her face was
fairly glowing when she opened the door.</p>

<p>A gentleman stood there; a man who was very
substantial-looking and by no means formidable
in appearance. The hall-light fell on him. It
seemed to Bonnie May that he was quite middle-aged.
He was well-dressed in a rather informal
way. A short-cropped black mustache had the
effect of retreating slightly between two ruddy
cheeks. His eyes expressed some degree of merriment—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
mischief, and this fact gave him standing
with Bonnie May immediately.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” said Bonnie May in her most
friendly manner. She waited, looking inquiringly
up into the twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>“I came to see Miss Baron. Is she at home?”</p>

<p>“Will you come in? I’ll see.”</p>

<p>She led the way into the big drawing-room,
which was in complete darkness, save for such
rays of light as penetrated from the hall. “I’m
afraid I’ll have to ask you to light the gas,” she
added. “It’s too high for me to reach.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’d better wait in the hall until you go
and tell Miss Flora.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Light the gas, please.”</p>

<p>He obeyed, and as the light fell suddenly upon
his face she saw that there was a mischievously meditative
gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>Still holding the burnt match in his fingers, he
turned to her. “I don’t believe I’ve met you before?”
he said.</p>

<p>“I only came to-day. Will you sit down?”</p>

<p>“You—living here?” The caller appeared to be
in no hurry to have his arrival announced. He
listened a moment to the faint voices above, and
seemed reassured.</p>

<p>“Why, yes—I think so. You see, I always live
wherever I happen to be.” She smiled brightly,
to rob her words of any seeming unfriendliness.
She regarded him more in detail. He was a big-bodied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> 
man, with a proper tendency to dwindle
away neatly from the shoulders down. His hair
was of the sort that refuses to be quite nice. It
was astonishingly thick and dark, with an occasional
glint of silver in it, and it was close-cropped.
She liked the way he stood, too; his chest well out,
his head back, and as if nothing could disturb his
balance. Bonnie May had seen so many men who
stood as if they needed propping up, or as if they
would be more secure if they had four legs to stand
on.</p>

<p>He returned her careful scrutiny, and the look
of approval in her eyes brought a ruddier glow to
his cheeks and a merrier look to his eyes.</p>

<p>He sat down and held out both his hands, smiling
so broadly that she could see many white,
lustrous teeth.</p>

<p>She put her hands into his without hesitation.
She felt extraordinarily happy.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she whispered, “are you the—the
Romeo in the cast?”</p>

<p>He released her hands and brought his own down
upon his knees with vehemence. His eyes were
almost shouting with merriment now.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t Romeo in kind of bad standing with
his prospective parents-in-law?”</p>

<p>“Something like that. He couldn’t see Her, except
up in a balcony.”</p>

<p>He nodded his head. “Well, then, I’m the
Romeo!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>Again she regarded him critically. “You seem
a little old for the part,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” He was thoughtful for a
moment. “Maybe that’s what Mrs. Baron thinks.
She won’t even let me stand under a balcony, when
she can help it.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she quaint!” This with smiling indulgence.
“But of course you don’t pay any attention
to that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes I do; we—we have to!”</p>

<p>Bonnie May looked puzzled. “I can’t understand
it,” she said. “You look like the kind that
they always play the loud music for.”</p>

<p>“The—loud music?” he echoed.</p>

<p>“As if you were the oldest son, come back in
the last act to lift the mortgage.”</p>

<p>They smiled into each other’s eyes, and then
Bonnie May drew close to him. She whispered:
“I’ll see if I can’t get her out of the balcony.” She
turned toward the door. “Shall I just tell her that
Romeo is here?”</p>

<p>He stared after her in delighted amazement.
“Lord help us, no! Say it’s Mr. Addis.” His face
radiated a joyous light even after she went out of
the room and softly closed the door.</p>

<p>She went up-stairs softly singing. At the door of
the sitting-room she paused. Within, Mrs. Baron
was reading one of those irreproachable-looking
books which are always about something very remote.
She did not look up at Bonnie May’s approach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Miss Baron occupied a soft seat in the bay window,
and it was clear that she was troubled a little.</p>

<p>The child beckoned, and Flora’s face instantly
brightened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron was fully aware of all that transpired.
She believed the guest was afraid of her.
She felt a mild gratification.</p>

<p>When Flora came out into the hall Bonnie May
whispered: “I want you to come down-stairs with
me.” She took Flora’s hand and patted it quite
blissfully.</p>

<p>They got to the foot of the stairs just in time to
see the outlines of a masculine form mounting the
front steps. The frosted glass in the door permitted
this much to be seen.</p>

<p>“Some one else!” commented Bonnie May, and
she turned to Flora. “Do you have so much company
every evening?” she asked.</p>

<p>“So much company!” echoed Flora; she looked
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind,” Bonnie May hastened to
add. “Some one is expecting you in the drawing-room.
And please let me receive the new visitor!”</p>

<p>She opened the drawing-room door, and watched
while Flora wonderingly entered. Then she pulled
the door to cautiously. She had heard a low, forlorn
note of surprise in Flora’s voice, and Mr.
Addis’s eager, whispered greeting.</p>

<p>Then she opened the front door in time to prevent
the newcomer from ringing.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_fp54">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fp54.jpg" alt="You seem a little old for the part">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“You seem a little old for the part,” she suggested.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>A young man of a rather assertive Bohemian
appearance stood before her.</p>

<p>“Hello!” was his greeting. The tone denoted
surprise, rather than familiarity. He hastily added:
“Excuse me—is Victor—Mr. Baron—in?”</p>

<p>Bonnie May perceived that he was not quite
comfortable, not at all self-possessed. He seemed
to her a strange person to be calling on any of the
Barons. Still, he seemed rather human.</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” she said. “Please step inside.” She
would make him wait in the hall, she decided.</p>

<p>“Tell him, please, that Baggot has called—that
I’ve brought the first act of my play.”</p>

<p>“A play! Oh!”</p>

<p>Again she hurried up the stairs; this time with
unconcealed eagerness. When she entered Mrs.
Baron’s room she hesitated. “If you’ll excuse
me—” she faltered. “I’m looking for Mr. Victor.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron sat more erect, the open volume in
her lap. “Forming a little organization down-stairs?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Some one’s called for Mr. Victor. I wanted to
tell him.”</p>

<p>“Very well. He’s in the library.” She nodded
toward the adjoining room.</p>

<p>Victor was alone in the library. He was in the
attitude of one who is about to write, but he was
not writing. He was glowering at the paper before
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>He sprang to his feet eagerly when Bonnie May
appeared.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about you,” he said. “Flora
has, too. We meant to come and find you before
long and get you away from Mrs. Shepard. We
didn’t want to seem too eager, you know. We
wanted to wait until the governess——”</p>

<p>Bonnie May did not wait for him to finish; indeed,
he seemed to have difficulty about finishing.
“Mr. Baggot has called,” she said. “It’s about a
play.” She was breathing uneasily. “And couldn’t
I sit with you and listen, please?” she added.</p>

<p>“Oh! Baggot! Baggot is one of my crosses,
Bonnie May. Couldn’t you shut the door in his
face? It would be quite proper. He is one of those
silly fellows who think they are destined to write
great plays. Couldn’t you go down and put him
out?”</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily without a word. She
was smiling a little scornfully.</p>

<p>“Very well. Suppose you go and ask him to
come up—this time.”</p>

<p>“And—do let me come too! They’ve often let
me listen when new plays were being read.”</p>

<p>“Such wanton cruelty!” He shook his head
slowly, as if it were quite incredible. “Oh, well
you may come, too,” he added.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron glanced up from her book again when
Bonnie May and Baggot passed through the room.
She spoke to Baggot in the most casual manner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Bonnie May concluded that he must be a somewhat
frequent visitor. Mrs. Baron was quite frank in
her indifference to him. “I think you’ll find Victor
in the library,” she said. She glanced pointedly at
the manuscript in his hand and frowned. “And
would you mind closing the door when you go in?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron achieved her cruelties sometimes with
such a naïve directness that they seemed to many
people like a kind of high breeding.</p>

<p>Baggot stepped gingerly into the next room, followed
eagerly by Bonnie May. He was closing the
door softly when Baron greeted him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Baggot. Done something great again,
of course?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have!” retorted Baggot angrily. He
wouldn’t endure Baron’s bad manners, no matter
how he might receive the bad manners of Baron’s
mother. “You’re going to say so, too. I’ve got
the first act finished. I’ve only got to fill in the
scenario of the other acts, and I’ve got the greatest
play that ever came out of America.”</p>

<p>Baron smiled wearily. “And I’m to listen while
you read the first act of the greatest play, etc.?”</p>

<p>“Yes—and you’re to agree with me, too. I
don’t see anything great in your sneering at me all
the time!” He pulled up a chair and sat down so
that his knees almost touched Baron’s.</p>

<p>Obviously, they were a pair of young men on
very intimate terms.</p>

<p>Bonnie May slipped into a remote corner of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
room and climbed into a big chair. Her hand supported
her chin; her eyes were luminous. She did
not mean to miss a word.</p>

<p>And Baggot began to read. His face was almost
tortured with nervous energy. He handled
the pages as if they were in hopeless confusion,
yet he brought order out of them swiftly.</p>

<p>The reading proceeded ten minutes, twenty
minutes, half an hour. Baggot read with profound
confidence and belief. His staccato tones
fairly hurled the words of the play at his auditors.
Baron had put away his cynic attitude. He had
become deeply impressed. He had even forgotten
that it was his favorite pose not to seem deeply
impressed by anything.</p>

<p>Bonnie May was like one in a beautiful dream.
She was not only listening to the play; she was
living it.</p>

<p>And then her dream was broken in a manner
which filled her mind with almost blank astonishment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Bonnie May,” she announced, “I think it’s
high time for a little girl to be in bed.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>CONCERNING A FROCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> might have been, and should have been,
apparent to the several members of the Baron
household that Bonnie May had been giving an
admirable exhibition of self-repression from the
moment she had entered the house.</p>

<p>A change came at last—when Mrs. Baron disturbed
the reading of the play and announced, at
nine o’clock, that it was “high time for a little
girl to be in bed.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron couldn’t possibly have realized how
Bonnie May had been accustomed to divide her
hours between sleeping and waking. The guest
had spent her life among player people, whose active
hours begin at noon or later, and who do not
deem the day ended until after midnight—sometimes
far later than midnight. Nor had it been
found convenient—or needful—by Bonnie May’s
fellow workers to make any exception to the rule
on her behalf. She had been one of them, and she
had fared well and pleasantly.</p>

<p>Thus it was that when Mrs. Baron appeared,
somewhat like a bolt out of a clear sky, the child
gave way to overwhelming rebellion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“I’m not used to going to bed at this hour,” she
declared bluntly. She arose and stood by her
chair, like a soldier by his guns, as the saying is.
And taking in the inexorable expression in Mrs.
Baron’s eyes, she turned appealingly to Baron.
She was relying upon him to help her.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t she—” began Baron weakly, and
added, quite without conviction: “You know it’s
Saturday night, mother!” He was glad he had
thought of its being Saturday, though he couldn’t
see why that should make very much difference.
He really believed his mother’s position was strong
enough, if she had only gone about the matter
more tactfully.</p>

<p>“Saturday night doesn’t make any difference,”
declared Bonnie May, her rebellion now including
Baron in its scope. “It just isn’t a reasonable
bedtime.”</p>

<p>Baron felt ready to surrender. “Anyway, it
won’t be so bad just for one night,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Victor,” said Mrs. Baron pointedly.
She addressed herself to Bonnie May.
“What you’ve been accustomed to may not be
quite so important as what you ought to become
accustomed to,” she said. “Come!”</p>

<p>The child sauntered thoughtfully from the room.
She had been impressed by the fact that even Baron
had not seemed surprised by the suggestion that
she ought to go to bed. She was trying to comprehend
the situation. After all, people who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
not of the profession had ways of their own, she
realized. If they had <i>all</i> decided to go to bed, she
wouldn’t have minded so much. But they were
laying down a special law for her.</p>

<p>Rebellion triumphed again. In Mrs. Baron’s
room she halted. “Where am I to sleep?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“I think you heard me tell Mrs. Shepard to prepare
a room.”</p>

<p>“In the attic? Yes. But I’m not going to sleep
there.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, you are.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon! Not under any circumstances!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron lifted her fingers to her lips and
coughed—a very inexpert cough. “You’ll have to
do as I tell you, you know.” She resumed a resolute
march toward the hall, her hand pressed
firmly against Bonnie May’s back.</p>

<p>The child jerked away with a sense of outrage.
She had never been treated so before.</p>

<p>“Truly, you’ll have to obey me,” repeated Mrs.
Baron.</p>

<p>Bonnie May was alarmed; she quite lost control
of herself. “Stop your kiddin’!” she said with a
catch in her voice. She tried to say it playfully,
but her self-possession was gone. Her remark
had sounded simply offensive, indelicate.</p>

<p>“And I can’t permit you to use such language,
either!” declared Mrs. Baron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>The dismayed guest pressed her hands to her
eyes as if she were trying to think clearly.</p>

<p>Then she made a rush for the stairway!</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron put dignity aside long enough to
pursue her, to seize her by the arm. She was becoming
outraged, greatly indignant. “What do
you mean to do?” she demanded, her voice trembling
slightly.</p>

<p>“I’m quitting.”</p>

<p>“You’re——”</p>

<p>“I won’t stay here!”</p>

<p>The distressed old gentlewoman tried to calm herself.
“Where do you think of going?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Anywhere—to the theatres. Any company in
town will be glad to have me. They will know who
I am. They—they are the kind of people who will
appreciate me!” The words were spoken in a tone
of heart-break, of despair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron afterward confessed to members of
her family that for the first time in her life she felt
completely helpless. She was, in truth, a somewhat
childish person in many ways, and she was not accustomed
to any unpleasantnesses save those which
she created for others.</p>

<p>At any rate, she swallowed with difficulty—and
surrendered. “It’s a very small point, after all,”
she said ungraciously. “Go into my room. Flora
will look after you.” She spoke coldly, all her
interest seemingly withdrawn.</p>

<p>And just as the guest disappeared into Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Baron’s sitting-room, Flora came almost stealthily
up the stairs.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d put that little limb of Satan to
bed,” she said. Flora saw that her mother’s hand,
on the balustrade, trembled.</p>

<p>“Where shall I put her?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Anywhere! just so you get her covered up for
the night.”</p>

<p>Flora paused, her eyes uneasily seeking her
mother’s.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re angry with me, mother,”
she said humbly.</p>

<p>“With you? Certainly not.”</p>

<p>Flora was puzzled. Her mother had long ago
declared that Mr. Addis must not be accepted as
a visitor. Did she know that he had just gone?
She was about to enter her mother’s sitting-room
when something prompted her to turn.</p>

<p>“You knew Mr. Addis called, didn’t you?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron’s face flamed again. “Knew it?
Certainly, I didn’t know it! I’ve told Mrs. Shepard—I
don’t intend that he shall annoy you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother! He doesn’t! And I think Mrs.
Shepard didn’t know, this time. Bonnie May
went to the door and let him in. She called me
down-stairs without telling me who it was.” Flora
surveyed her mother yearningly, yet with a kind
of gentle courage. “I don’t believe in hiding things
from you, mother. But I was glad to see him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Mrs. Baron looked grimly toward her own door.
“<i>She</i> let him in! Very well. Put her to bed!”</p>

<p>She descended the stairs with dignity. She
must have been thinking of future victories rather
than of past defeats.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Flora entered the sitting-room she found
Bonnie May standing in uneasy contemplation.</p>

<p>“Mother says I’m to put you to bed,” said Miss
Baron.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t she go ahead and put me to bed
herself?”</p>

<p>Flora perceived that the question was not wanting
in sincerity. She decided to answer quite honestly.</p>

<p>“I think,” she ventured gently, “you must have
said something to vex her.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. She tried to vex me. I behaved
very properly.”</p>

<p>Flora sighed and shook her head slowly; but
she was smiling, too. She was wondering what it
really was that had gone wrong. “Possibly you
didn’t want to obey her?” she ventured.</p>

<p>The child’s brow puckered. “But why should
I want to obey her?”</p>

<p>“Why—because she’s going to be good to you,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean to be good to her, too—if she’ll
let me. And I don’t ask her to obey me.”</p>

<p>“But it’s different. She’s an old lady.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Well, I’ve got no patience with old people.
It’s all right, just as a <i>part</i>, but there’s no use putting
it on all the time.”</p>

<p>“But, dear,” implored Flora, drawing the child
within the curve of her arm, “don’t say that! I
know you mean to be nice and kind, but truly you
don’t understand. We must all grow old some
time—even you will get to be old.”</p>

<p>The guest gave deliberate thought to this; then
her expression became resolute. “Well, if they
ever hang any gray hairs on me they’ll have to
catch me when I’m asleep—I’ll tell you that right
now.”</p>

<p>Miss Baron was not encouraged to argue the
point any further. She resumed the subject of
going to bed.</p>

<p>“You know I’m to have his room—your
brother’s?” the guest insisted.</p>

<p>“Mother said you might sleep where you liked.”</p>

<p>“Did she say that?”</p>

<p>“Almost exactly.”</p>

<p>“Well, where is that attic room?”</p>

<p>“It’s up one more flight of stairs—under the roof.”</p>

<p>The child looked quite wistful and earnest, and
then her words came with conviction. “I just
couldn’t sleep up there. Attics are where misers
sleep, and poor children. It’s where people die of
hunger and cold. It’s never the right kind of people.
Come, let’s go to his room.”</p>

<p>And so they did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“You won’t mind my helping you?” pleaded
Flora.</p>

<p>“Helping me?”</p>

<p>“To undress, you know—and to be tucked in!”</p>

<p>The guest looked at her unresponsively. “But
I’ve been used to doing that for myself,” she said.</p>

<p>Flora quickly stooped and took her into her
arms impulsively. “Dear child,” she cried, her
voice tremulous, “let me do it to-night! I think
you’ll love it—and I’ll love it, too.” She drew the
perplexed face almost roughly against her own.</p>

<p>She did not wait to be refused. She hurried
into the bathroom and busied herself; she was
singing a little crooning song. There was also the
noise of water splashing into the tub.</p>

<p>She reappeared presently. “The water is ready—for
your bath, you know, and I’ve left one of my
nighties there for you.” She smiled happily. “Of
course it will be too big. I’ll make you some little
ones soon.”</p>

<p>The seeming perversion of the child asserted itself
again. “I usually take my bath in the morning,”
she said a little stiffly; but she saw how the
glad light in Miss Baron’s eyes wavered, and she
added quickly, “but it will be all right.” And
she went out into the bathroom.</p>

<p>When she reappeared after a rather long time
she was smiling radiantly. She had on Flora’s
nightgown, soft and white, with pink ribbons. She
held it daintily up before her feet, and glanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
back at the train that dragged behind. “Isn’t it
lovely!” she said.</p>

<p>“It is, dear,” said Flora.</p>

<p>She had turned the white coverlet and the sheet
down. Now she watched the child scramble up into
the bed. She wanted to help, but she refrained.</p>

<p>“Would you like me to tell you a story?” asked
Flora.</p>

<p>Bonnie May looked at her swiftly, incredulously.
“No!” she said. She burst out into riotous laughter.
“I’m not an <i>infant</i>,” she explained.</p>

<p>Flora flushed. “Very well,” she said gently.
Yet she lingered in the room a little while. She
put some of Victor’s masculine decorations out of
sight. She adjusted the blind. She was about to
extinguish the light when she looked again at the
strange guest.</p>

<p>The child’s eyes were fixed upon her widely,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“You lovely thing!” said Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“Good night, dear!” said Flora. And then she
knew that the child wished to speak to her, and
she went over and bent above the bed. “What
is it, Bonnie May?” she asked.</p>

<p>The child stared before her in silence for a moment
and then the words came. “I wished so
much that she would love me!” she said. “I tried
so hard....”</p>

<p>Flora slipped her hand under the guest’s head.
“I’ll tell you a secret,” she whispered. “If she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
hadn’t cared for you, she would have been quite
polite; she would have been wonderfully gracious.
She was ungracious and unkind because—because
she loved you, dear. It seems absurd, doesn’t it?
But I know.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was an absurd theory, perhaps; yet there was
certainly needed some explanation of Mrs. Baron’s
course later in the evening.</p>

<p>The house became quiet after a time. The rumbling
voices in the library ceased and Baggot, with
meticulous circumspection, wended his way down
the stairs and was gone. Later, Victor emerged
from the library and disappeared for the night.
Baron, Sr., came in and sat and smoked awhile—and
retired. Flora sat in the sitting-room lingeringly,
gazing pensively at a book without turning
its pages, and at length she arose and kissed her
mother’s cheek and said good night.</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Baron tiptoed into another room
and rummaged in a bureau drawer and found a gay
piece of gingham which had been waiting its time to
be useful. With this in her hands she returned to
her sitting-room, and spread work materials upon
her table. And with patience and fortitude and a
kind of rapt self-absorption she worked far into the
night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The usual Sunday-morning quietude of the mansion
was disturbed somewhat when the family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
again assembled. An extraordinary event had occurred.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron had sat up late the night before and
had made a Dress.</p>

<p>In announcing the fact she had pronounced the
word in such a manner that the use of the capital
letter is fully justified. She displayed the Dress
for the admiration of her son and her daughter,
and her husband. And finally she generously relinquished
it to Flora. “You may give it to her,”
she said rather loftily.</p>

<p>Bonnie May had not yet appeared.</p>

<p>Flora, knocked softly on the guest’s door and
without waiting went into the room, displaying the
new garment rather conspicuously.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired Bonnie May dubiously.</p>

<p>“It’s a new dress for you.”</p>

<p>“It was never made for me,” affirmed the child
with conviction.</p>

<p>“Indeed, it was. Mother sat up ever so late
last night and made it for you.”</p>

<p>“Well, that, of course, was a matter I should
have been consulted about.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May was now sitting on the edge of the
bed, trying to make the toes of one foot come in
contact with the floor. Miss Baron sat on a low
chair in the middle of the room, the new dress
spread across her knees.</p>

<p>“But you’re glad, aren’t you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’m glad in a way. I’m glad that anybody so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
disagreeable could really try to do you a good
turn.” Clearly, each day was a new day, with
Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“But, dear child, mother won’t seem disagreeable
to you when you come to know her. It hurts
me to have you speak so of her—truly it does.
And I think she must have worked until she was
very weary, making the dress for you.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate all that,” the guest hastened to
explain, genuine compunction in her voice. “But
you see, the dress isn’t at all suitable.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’ll like it much better when you
try it on.”</p>

<p>“Take my word for it—it won’t do.”</p>

<p>Miss Baron felt for the moment as if she could
have pounced upon the child and spanked her.
But she noticed how one curl fell outside her ear,
and how the eyes and voice were profoundly earnest,
and how the attitude was eloquent of a kind of repentance
before the fact.</p>

<p>And so she said: “Won’t you do something for
me that will please me better than anything else
I can think of—something that will take only a
minute?”</p>

<p>Bonnie May looked at her meditatively—and
then began to laugh quite riotously! “You don’t
look the part!” she gurgled in justification.</p>

<p>“What part, please?” The question was put
somewhat blankly.</p>

<p>“You’re talking like a—oh, a Lady Clare, and
you haven’t even got your shoes buttoned up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Miss Baron slowly regarded her shoes; then her
glance travelled calmly to Bonnie May; then she
rather dully inspected the dress that lay across
her knees. Her countenance had become inscrutable.
She turned away from the guest’s scrutiny,
and after a moment she arose slowly and left the
room, carrying the dress with her.</p>

<p>She did not stop to define her feelings. She was
wounded, but she felt sharp resentment, and she
was thinking rebelliously that she was in no degree
responsible for Bonnie May. Still ... her sense
of justice stayed her. She had the conviction that
the child’s remark, if inexcusably frank, was a fair
one. And it had been made so joyously!</p>

<p>However, she meant to go to her mother with a
request to be excused from any further humiliation
as Bonnie May’s handmaiden. But before she had
proceeded half a dozen steps she began to fear
even greater disaster, if Mrs. Baron should undertake
to be the bearer of the rejected dress.</p>

<p>It would be a victory worth working for, if she
could overcome the fastidious guest’s prejudice.</p>

<p>She went to her room and carefully buttoned her
shoes and made other improvements in her toilet.
Then she went back into Bonnie May’s presence.</p>

<p>“I <i>was</i> untidy,” she confessed. “I hope you’ll
excuse me.” She was smoothing out the new dress.
“You see, I only meant to wear my every-day shoes
until after breakfast, and then put on my good
shoes, for Sunday-school and church. And I’ve
been very busy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Bonnie May pondered this judicially. “It’s
lovely of you to be so nice about it,” she finally
admitted, “but I’m afraid I don’t get your
idea....” She frowned. “Every-day shoes’ and
‘Sunday shoes,’” she repeated vaguely.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Flora persuasively.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like to be as good on Saturday as
on Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes—just as good, certainly.” Flora was
looking bewildered.</p>

<p>“And on Friday, and on other days?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t you wear your ‘good’ shoes
all the week, then?”</p>

<p>“But people must look nicer on Sundays than
on other days.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why. If you only look nice, I
don’t see what’s the good. And if you really are
nice, I think the nice shoes might help all the
time.”</p>

<p>“What I mean is,” persisted Flora patiently,
“I don’t like to work in my nice shoes.” She brought
this out somewhat triumphantly.</p>

<p>“That’s funny. That’s the very time I like to
look my best. Nothing is as important as your
work, is it?”</p>

<p>Flora was almost in despair. “I doubt if I ever
thought of it in just that light,” she admitted.
“I’ll think it over, if you’ll try the dress on—and
if you don’t like it, off it comes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Well, all right.” (This with a sudden calm
which was not reassuring.)</p>

<p>Flora slipped the gingham dress into place, and
patted it here and there with the air of one who
admires, and viewed it with her head inclined a
little, as women do in such a situation. “It’s the
dearest thing!” she said honestly. “Now come
and see how you look.”</p>

<p>The mirror was a little high. She lifted Bonnie
May to a chair.</p>

<p>She was alarmed by what ensued. The child
stared fixedly, with incredulous eyes in which a
great horror grew.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” she cried, clapping her hands over
her eyes. “Take it off! Take it off!”</p>

<p>“What in the world is the matter?” demanded
Flora.</p>

<p>“She asks me what is the matter! Oh, heavens!”
Bonnie May jumped down from the chair and
turned her back to the mirror. She was wringing
her hands.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand at all!” exclaimed Miss
Baron hopelessly.</p>

<p>“You might!” was the emphatic rejoinder. “Do
you suppose I want to play that kind of a part—here?
It might do for the little sister of a sewing-machine
girl, or a mountain-pink with her hair in
knobs. But it wouldn’t do for anything else. If
you was only one of the populace, a costume like
that would cause a scream! If you don’t understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
it, take my word for it. I can’t wear it! I
ask you to take it off!”</p>

<p>Miss Baron became very quiet. She became
thoughtful, too. She had not failed to catch the
drift of these exaggerated words. There <i>was</i> something
prim, something rudimentary, about the
dress. Color suffused her cheeks; she hung her
head. She felt a forlorn inclination to laugh. From
a vantage point behind the child she began to remove
the gingham dress.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> inappropriate. She had to admit it. It
was a dress for a Gretchen; for the Cinderella of
the kitchen, rather than the princess of the coach-and-four.
It wasn’t becoming at all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>A SUNDAY MORNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Barons were the kind of family that have
just one morning newspaper left at their door on
Sunday, and who believe that it contains everything
that ought to concern them in any way—that
whatever is published in any other newspaper
is to be regarded with scepticism, or lightly discredited.</p>

<p>Yet on this particular Sunday morning Victor
Baron arose early and intercepted the paper-carrier,
and amazed that industrious youth by buying a
copy of every journal he carried.</p>

<p>With this not inconsiderable burden under his
arm he betook himself to the library and began an
eager search for certain information.</p>

<p>He scanned all the advertising columns systematically,
and then turned to the news departments.</p>

<p>A great heap of discarded “sections” grew about
him as he progressed, and little by little a look of
troubled anticipation vanished from his eyes. The
last section of the last paper was cast away with
an air of triumph.</p>

<p>He hadn’t been able to find a single word about
any child who was lost, or who had strayed, or who
had been stolen!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Good!” he exclaimed, and he looked with great
relief at the heap of papers about him, their splotches
of color and assertive head-lines having no further
interest for him. He smiled complacently.</p>

<p>In the meantime, in the sunny sitting-room up-stairs,
Flora had broken the news to Mrs. Baron—the
news touching Bonnie May and the new dress.</p>

<p>It had been a very difficult thing to do, because
Mrs. Baron was always at her worst on Sunday
mornings.</p>

<p>It was on Sunday mornings that she felt most
keenly the lapse of the neighborhood from former
glories to a condition of sordid griminess. It was
on these mornings that she fared forth to the old
church, only three blocks away, in which the best
people in town had formerly worshipped, but which
had been deserted by nearly all the old parishioners.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Baron’s contention that it was indelicate,
to say the least, for people to desert a
church. There were things in the church life, she
maintained, which could not be transplanted, and
which constituted the very warp and woof of the
domestic as well as the social foundations. She
had come to regard herself as a kind of standard-bearer
in this relationship, and she attended services
somewhat ostentatiously, with the belief that
she was not only lending her influence, but administering
a rebuke as well. Ignoring the protests
of her family, she had even consented to play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
the organ for the Sunday-school services. As a
young lady she had learned to read music, as a
matter of course, and though she possessed no
musical intelligence, and had found it impossible to
regain the old manual skill she had once possessed,
she played the simple hymns with a kind of proud
rigor, because she believed her participation in the
services in this direction must impart an authority
to the proceedings which the abler playing of some
obscure individual could not have imparted.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mrs. Baron was a personage on Sunday
mornings; a gallant general leading a forlorn hope
proudly and firmly.</p>

<p>When Flora confessed to her that the dress had
been rejected, she was too greatly amazed to say
a great deal. She had also entered upon her stoic
mood—her Sunday-morning mood.</p>

<p>“You see, she is simply determined not to get
along,” she declared with finality. She took the
dress into her own hands and regarded it critically.
“Do you see how carefully the feather-stitching is
done?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Flora, “the—the feather-stitching
<i>is</i> beautiful. But really, I don’t believe she is
simply perverse. If you could have seen the dismay
in her eyes—” Flora smiled at the recollection.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen women like that,” Mrs. Baron continued,
“women who like to make difficulties; who
go into hysterics over little things. It’s always
just a lack of sense—that’s all it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“Yes—or temperament. I expect there’s a good
deal in what people call temperament. I didn’t
know children had it so much, but Bonnie May
isn’t like other children. Maybe she has a good
deal of temperament.”</p>

<p>They examined the dress together without any
very definite purpose.</p>

<p>“She ought to know she can’t go on wearing that
silly thing she came here in,” was Mrs. Baron’s
next comment.</p>

<p>“She must realize that,” agreed Flora. She
added casually: “I think something soft, with a
little color in it, might please her. You might let
me try next time.”</p>

<p>This was the wrong note again. “As if I weren’t
capable of making a child’s dress!” protested Mrs.
Baron.</p>

<p>“I only meant it would be fair to divide the
work,” Flora explained gently. “I didn’t mean I
could do it better.”</p>

<p>As if her anger had been effectually checked in
that direction, Mrs. Baron hit upon another possible
grievance. “And she’s going to Sunday-school
to-day,” she affirmed in a tone which seemed
to take account of difficulties. “We’ve done our
best to dress her decently. And I don’t intend to
humor a little pagan as long as she’s in a Christian
household.”</p>

<p>“But in that—that peculiar dress?” faltered
Flora. She had a vision of Bonnie May in her
fantastic old frock associating with the prim children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
of poverty who were now the mainstay of the
Sunday-school.</p>

<p>“She may walk with Mrs. Shepard. People may
believe she belongs to her, if they want to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother!” There was something almost
despairing in Flora’s tone.</p>

<p>“It’s the best we can do. I mean to do my duty—and
I’m not willing to look ridiculous.”</p>

<p>Again Miss Baron perceived breakers ahead.
If the child conceived the idea that she was being
commanded to go anywhere she would very probably
develop new methods of resistance. If she
were politely invited to accompany other members
of the household to church, she might decide to be
altogether gracious.</p>

<p>She entertained a lingering regret that the guest
could not be persuaded to wear the new dress—in
which, certainly, she would be conspicuous enough,
but not quite in a flaunting fashion. She even
thought of Victor, and wondered if he might not
be able to prevail upon the child to accede to the
wishes of her elders. But upon second thought
she decided not to involve her brother in a phase
of the problem which did not touch him. She suspected
there would be other phases, more in his
line, in due time.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the meanwhile, the object of all this solicitous
thought was leisurely preparing to make her appearance.</p>

<p>That she had no fresh raiment to put on was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
not particularly disquieting. The fact that it was
a Sunday morning made no difference to her at
all. Certainly she needed fresh linen, but this,
she philosophically concluded, would be provided
within another day or two. Her shoes were quite
new and neat, and she was by no means ashamed
of the dress which now constituted her complete
wardrobe.</p>

<p>On a chair by her bed she made discoveries.
There was a fresh towel; a little package which
obviously contained a tooth-brush; a box of tooth-powder,
and—crowning gift—a new hair-ribbon of
adorable width and hue.</p>

<p>She tucked these things under one arm, and with
her free hand she carefully gathered Flora’s long
nightgown away from her feet. Then she started
to the bathroom.</p>

<p>In the hall she paused to be sure that the way
was clear.</p>

<p>Silence reigned, save for the murmur of voices
down-stairs—far, indistinct.</p>

<p>The hall was glorious with indirect rays of the
sun. It had wonderful spaciousness, too. Bonnie
May gazed down the broad stairway, duskily bright
and warm and silent, and her expression was quite
blissful. She turned and looked up to the landing
above—reached by a narrower flight of stairs. It
seemed splendidly remote, and here the sunlight
fell in a riotous flood.</p>

<p>Her sensations must have been something akin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to those of a mocking-bird that inspects the vernal
world in May. She released the folds of the nightgown
and “paraded” to and fro in the hall, looking
back over her shoulder at the train. She had put
the garment on again, after Flora’s advent with
the gingham dress, primarily for the purpose of
making the journey from her room to her bath.
But there had been a distinct pleasure in wearing
it, too. She thought it made her look like a fairy
queen. She felt the need of a tinsel crown and a
wand with a gilded star at its end.</p>

<p>She was executing a regal turn in the hall when
her glance was attracted upward to some moving
object on the landing above.</p>

<p>A most extraordinary ancient man stood there
watching her.</p>

<p>Realizing that he had been discovered, he turned
in a kind of panic and disappeared into regions unknown.
His mode of locomotion was quite unusual.
If Bonnie May had been familiar with nautical
terms she would have said that he was tacking, as
he made his agitated exit.</p>

<p>As for Bonnie May, she scampered into the bathroom,
the flowing train suddenly gripped in her
fingers.</p>

<p>Down-stairs they were listening for her, though
they pretended not to be doing so. They heard
her in the bathroom; later they heard movements
in her bedroom. And at last she was descending
the stairs leisurely, a care-free song on her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>She invaded the dining-room. Mr. Baron had
been lingering over his coffee. The various parts
of the morning paper were all about him.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” was Bonnie May’s greeting.
She nodded brightly. “I hope I’m not intruding?”</p>

<p>“Not at all!” Mr. Baron glanced at her with
real friendliness. It had not occurred to him that
her dress was fantastic. What he had noticed was
that her face was positively radiant, and that she
spoke as he imagined a duchess might have done.</p>

<p>“You might like to look at the colored supplement,”
he added, fishing around through the various
sections of the paper at his feet.</p>

<p>“I thank you, I’m sure; but isn’t it rather silly?”
She added deferentially: “Is there a theatrical
page?”</p>

<p>Mr. Baron coughed slightly, as he always did
when he was disconcerted. “There is, I believe,”
he said. He glanced over his shoulder toward a
closed door. “I’m not sure Mrs. Baron would approve
of your looking at the theatrical department
on Sunday,” he added.</p>

<p>“Really! And you don’t think she’d see any
harm in looking at the comic pictures?”</p>

<p>Mr. Baron removed his glasses and wiped them
carefully. “She would probably regard the comic
pictures as the lesser of two evils,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, I never did like to be a piker. If I’m going
into a thing, I like to go in strong.” She made
this statement pleasantly.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Mr. Baron put his glasses on somewhat hurriedly
and looked hard at the child. He perceived that
she was looking at him frankly and with a slight
constriction at her throat, as was always the case
when she felt she must hold her ground against
attack.</p>

<p>“I rather think you’re right,” he said reassuringly.
“I’m not sure I know how to find the theatrical
page. Would you mind looking?”</p>

<p>But Flora interrupted here. She entered the
room with the air of one who has blessings to bestow.</p>

<p>“You’re invited to go to Sunday-school with us
after a while,” she informed the guest.</p>

<p>“You’re very kind, I’m sure. What’s it like?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are children, and music, and—” Flora
paused. She wished to make her statement attractive
as well as truthful.</p>

<p>“A kind of spectacle?” suggested the guest.</p>

<p>“Hardly that. But there’s somebody to tell
stories. It’s very nice, I think.”</p>

<p>“It certainly sounds good to me. If they’ve
got any good people I might like to get into it,
until I find an opening in my own line.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baron removed his glasses again. “Flora,
would you undertake to tell me what she means?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>Miss Baron pinched her lips and looked at him
with a kind of ripple of joy in her eyes. “Isn’t
it plain?” she asked. She went out of the room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
then, and he heard her laughing somewhere in the
distance.</p>

<p>He coughed again and turned to his paper, and
so, for the first time in her life, Bonnie May was in
a fair way of going to Sunday-school.</p>

<p>Victor didn’t approve of the idea at all, when it
was presently made known to him. He waylaid
his mother in the dining-room at a time when there
was no one else about.</p>

<p>“Why not wait until she can get some things?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Victor,” replied Mrs. Baron, holding her head
very high, “you’re assuming that that extraordinary
little creature is going to stay here. I assure
you, she’s not. This may be the only chance
she’ll ever have to place herself in the way of a
helpful influence on Sunday. She’s going to Sunday-school
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Governess,” responded Victor, smiling steadily,
“if you don’t quit getting angry with me I
mean to sue for separate maintenance. Mark my
words.” After which nothing more was said on
the subject.</p>

<p>Victor betook himself to the library, however,
and indulged in a moment of fidgeting. Breakers
were ahead—that was certain.</p>

<p>It was forcing things, anyway. He took down
his Emerson and turned to a passage which his
mother long ago had pronounced a thing holding
low heathen sentiments. He read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“And why drag this dead weight of a Sunday-school
over the whole of Christendom? It is beautiful
and natural that children should inquire and
maturity should teach, but it is time enough to
answer questions when they are asked. Do not
shut up the young people against their will in a
pew and force the children to ask them questions
against their will.”</p>

<p>He could not dismiss from his mind the picture
of Bonnie May asking questions in her elfin yet
penetrating way, and he realized that the answers
she would get in that place of ordered forms and
conventions might be very far from satisfactory
to one of her somewhat fearful frankness and
honesty.</p>

<p>But suddenly he smiled at the pictures he was
drawing in his mind. “She seems pretty well able
to take care of herself,” he concluded.</p>

<p>He came upon the heaped sections of the newspapers
he had examined. That reminded him.
The newspapers were not the only source of information—nor
perhaps the most likely source—so
far as his immediate needs were concerned.</p>

<p>No, there was a certain visit he must make that
morning.</p>

<p>A little later he emerged from the mansion and
stood for an instant on the steps in the brilliant
sunlight. Then he descended the steps and was
gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>STILL UNCLAIMED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron</span> was on his way to see Thornburg.</p>

<p>On six days and seven nights Thornburg was
one of the busiest men in town. But there was
one day in the week when he liked to pose as a
man of leisure. From ten or eleven o’clock on
Sunday morning, and until the latter part of the
afternoon, there were few people about the theatre
to disturb him or to claim his attention. And
during these hours it was his practise to lean back
in the comfortable chair in his private office in the
theatre and look through old letters and souvenirs,
if there were no callers, or to exchange current
gossip or old reminiscences with the people of his
profession who dropped in to see him. Usually
these were managers or agents who happened to
be in town, and sometimes there were veteran
players who were retired, or who were temporarily
unemployed. And occasionally there were politicians
who liked to keep on affable terms with the
source of free passes.</p>

<p>When Baron entered the manager’s presence he
found that usually engaged person quite at liberty.</p>

<p>The little office was a place which was not without
its fascination to most people. On the walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
there were framed photographs of Jefferson as
Rip Van Winkle, of Booth as Richard III, of
Modjeska as Portia, and of other notable players.
In many cases the pictures bore sprawling autographs
across their faces, low enough not to hurt.
Between these authentic ornaments there were
fanciful sketches of dancing girls in extravagant
costumes and postures, and a general ornamentation
scheme of masks and foils and armor.</p>

<p>So complacent and open-minded was Thornburg
when Baron appeared that the latter came
to a swift, seemingly irrelevant conclusion.</p>

<p>“Nobody has claimed her! She’s going to stay!”
were the words that formed themselves in Baron’s
mind. The dull, monotonous aspects of the old
mansion were to be changed. A new voice, like a
melody rising above droning chords, was to greet
his ears at morning and night. A thing of beauty
was to take its place before the background of dull,
long-established things.</p>

<p>No one had come to Thornburg to demand of
him the child who had disappeared from his premises—Baron
could read as much in the manager’s
expression. Wonderful! Truly wonderful!</p>

<p>“You haven’t had any word yet?” he began.</p>

<p>Thornburg was used to Baron’s ways. He had
a friendly contempt for the dilettante young man
about town and newspaper writer who could have
made a place for himself, as everybody agreed, if
he had chosen to do so, but who indulged himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
by following his own ill-directed bent, merely because
he was—well, because he was Baron—or <i>a</i>
Baron.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” he replied, smiling indulgently,
as if the matter were really not at all surprising.</p>

<p>Baron read the other’s thought. “But a child
like that!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“People are sometimes strange,” said Thornburg.
“Now, if she had been a trained dog, or a
cat with an unusual pedigree, or a horse with power
to draw loads—then she would have been hunted
up quick enough. But you see, she’s only a child.”</p>

<p>Baron shook his head. He was rejecting all
this as inadequate.</p>

<p>“She’s still with you?” continued the manager.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m hoping she’ll remain with us.”</p>

<p>“She like it there?”</p>

<p>“Like it?” echoed Baron. He couldn’t answer
the question. He thought of something more pertinent
to say. “It means that she will have a home—if
we can keep her.”</p>

<p>Thornburg nodded slowly. “I don’t think anything
better could happen to her than for you to
keep her,” he said. “I suppose she’ll get the kind
of care a little girl of her kind needs. If she’s just
a waif of the theatre she probably has a lot to learn
about—oh, about life and real things.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” Baron agreed. He added: “I
was hoping you might throw some light on the
case—as to who she is and where she came from.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Thornburg shook his head. “No, I couldn’t,”
he said.</p>

<p>“About her coming to the theatre——”</p>

<p>“A woman brought her to the theatre and asked
to be admitted. She belonged to the profession—the
woman. We usually pass them in if there’s
any room. There happened to be just one seat
left down-stairs—in the back row—and I told her
she could have that. I supposed she would hold
the little girl on her lap. I was provoked when I
saw she had let her wander up into the box where
you were. In fact, I spoke to her about it.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know who the woman was—even
by reputation?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are thousands of such people—people
who are ‘of the profession.’ Vaudeville people,
circus performers, members of little stock companies,
third-rate travelling troupes—they all ask
for free seats.”</p>

<p>Baron reflected. “I suppose,” he said at length,
“such people are often in financial straits?”</p>

<p>“My goodness, yes! Almost always.”</p>

<p>“If she—this actress—had really wanted to find
the child, she surely would have made inquiries
here at the theatre before now, wouldn’t she?”</p>

<p>“It would seem so—certainly.”</p>

<p>“What I’m getting at is this: It looks a good
deal like deliberate desertion, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should say so.”</p>

<p>“And that’s what I simply can’t believe,” declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Baron. “Still,” he added, “under the circumstances,
I ought to be justified in not saying
anything—in assuming that I have a right to keep
what has come into my possession?”</p>

<p>“Well, for the time being, certainly. Of course,
there may be developments sooner or later. She
must belong to somebody; I mean, she must have
a home somewhere.”</p>

<p>“No, she hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“But of course you can’t be sure of that.”</p>

<p>“I am. She’s my authority.”</p>

<p>“You mean she told you that? It was probably
a childish fancy—or a downright falsehood.
You have to take into account all manner of possible
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I think she told me the truth. She doesn’t
seem fanciful, in that way. She has the most remarkable
sort of intelligence—of frankness.”</p>

<p>Thornburg’s eyes brightened with interest. “Has
she, really?” he asked. There was an interval of
silence and then the manager laughed. “It strikes
me that you’re an odd sort of a chap, Baron,” he
said. “What was your idea in taking her home—a
stray child like that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was so very remarkable. She
wanted to go with me, for one thing. She seemed
quite delighted at the prospect of having a real
home.”</p>

<p>The manager turned this statement over in his
mind so long that Baron supposed he was thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
of something else. He sat, his hands clasped behind
his head, regarding one of the pictures on the
wall, well over Baron’s head. Then he aroused
himself abruptly.</p>

<p>“What’s your plan regarding her?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I’ve got that far yet. She’ll
have the usual schooling and the sort of training
that is customary. When she’s grown—Well,
it’s hard to look far ahead, where a child like that
is concerned. Of course, if Miss Barry ever turns
up.... She would have claims we couldn’t ignore.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Miss Barry?”</p>

<p>“She’s the woman who brought Bonnie May to
the theatre. If you know of an actress by that
name——”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“She probably hasn’t very much standing. From
what Bonnie May said I judge she belongs to that
vast army we never hear much about in the
cities.”</p>

<p>“It’s like this, Baron,” said the manager, with
the air of a man who hasn’t time for useless speculations,
“I’m thinking, and I suppose you’re thinking,
that under the circumstances I ought to assume
some of the responsibility for a waif who was
lost on my premises. I’d want to be fair about it,
you know.”</p>

<p>“But I wasn’t thinking anything of the kind,”
declared Baron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>Thornburg frowned impatiently. “She’ll be a
burden to you, of course,” he argued. “And there’s
clearly my share of the responsibility——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything about a burden. The
word was yours. Of course I had to take her home
with me. Or at least that’s the way I felt about it.
You simply couldn’t turn a child like that over to
an orphan asylum, or to the police. You would as
readily think of asking some grand dame to turn
a handspring as to expect Bonnie May to put on
a uniform with a lot of other unclaimed children,
and go through the usual order of childish occupations.
Somebody has got to look after her in a different
way: somebody who understands. But I
wouldn’t think of her being a burden any more
than I would think of pigeons or flowers being a
burden.”</p>

<p>Again Thornburg laughed. “Still, most people
are pretty willing not to have white elephants
thrust upon them.”</p>

<p>Baron regarded him steadily, in silence. There
was a sort of threat in that—or a prophecy. And
there was indicated that attitude of mind which
sees no beauty in a generous deed. And these
were reflections which Baron did not care to put
into words.</p>

<p>The manager became uncomfortable under that
glance. “You see,” he explained, “I can’t help
thinking.... Is it possible that a little footlight
butterfly will be comfortable very long in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
home like—in a home where everything is—is just
so?” He flushed a little from the effort to avoid
offensive inferences or words. “Won’t she be
lonesome and out of place after the novelty of the
thing passes?”</p>

<p>Baron liked that. It was frank and honest. “I
don’t think she’ll be lonesome,” he declared.
“Mother will see that she gets interested in things:
in music, probably, or anything she manifests a
taste for. She’s too bright to feel out of place, if
she’s helped in the right way.”</p>

<p>“It might work out all right.” Thornburg
nodded. “I’ll tell you,” he added, “suppose you
let me help with the job.”</p>

<p>“Help!” echoed Baron. “You mean——”</p>

<p>“By writing a little check once a month.”</p>

<p>“That won’t be necessary. So far as the expense
is concerned that will scarcely be worth
considering.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You could use it, if only for extra
dresses and trinkets. I’ve no doubt she’ll want a
lot of things.”</p>

<p>That was exactly like a theatrical man’s ideas,
Baron thought. But he couldn’t tell Thornburg
that his mother would be sure to oppose anything
that would tend to promote childish vanity, especially
in the case of one who was already inclined
to overestimate mere appearances. The gewgaws
of the average petted and spoiled child would have
to give place to simplicity and true childishness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Still, he didn’t wish to offend Thornburg, whose
suggestion had doubtless been based upon a generous
impulse.</p>

<p>“It might be managed,” he said. “We’ll speak
of that another time.”</p>

<p>He arose and began to shape a casual exit.
“There’s nobody now to take <i>their</i> places,” he said,
indicating the portraits of Jefferson and Booth and
the others.</p>

<p>“Not by a thousand miles,” agreed Thornburg.
His thoughts seemed to have been transferred easily
to the players who were gone.</p>

<p>But when Baron emerged from the theatre and
lost himself in the throng which the fine May forenoon
had attracted from hotels and side streets,
his face brightened with the joy which he felt he
need no longer conceal.</p>

<p>“She’s ours!” were the words that sang within
him. “We’re going to keep her!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>A DISAPPOINTING PERFORMANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron</span> looked at his watch twice as he climbed
the stairs. Yes, the family had had time to return
from church; but they had not done so. Mrs.
Shepard was busy in the dining-room, but otherwise
the house was unoccupied. Silence reigned
in the upper regions.</p>

<p>Thomason, the houseman, was looking impatiently
down from the upper landing; but Thomason
didn’t count. He was probably hungry. Baron
realized that he, too, was hungry.</p>

<p>He went into the cheerful sitting-room and
looked down upon the street, and instantly his attitude
changed.</p>

<p>There they came! And something was wrong.
Oh, plainly, something was wrong.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron’s head was held high; she was pale;
her lips were compressed. There was nothing gracious
in her carriage. She was marching.</p>

<p>By her side walked Flora, keeping step with difficulty.
She appeared to be fighting off all realization
of her mother’s state.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shepard was no longer present to lend her
support to Bonnie May. The faithful servitor had
come home immediately after Sunday-school to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
look after the dinner, and the child walked alone,
behind her silent elders. Her whole being radiated
defiance. She was apparently taking in every aspect
of the street, but her casual bearing was obviously
studied; the determined effort she was making
was not to be concealed.</p>

<p>Baron hurried down-stairs so that he might
meet them in the hall, and engineer a temporary
dispersement. He was affecting a calm and leisurely
demeanor when the door opened and Mrs. Baron,
followed by the others, entered.</p>

<p>There was an ominous silence. Bonnie May
caught sight of Baron and approached him with
only a partial concealment of eagerness and hurry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron and Flora ascended the stairs: the
former leading the way sternly; the latter moving
upward with wan cheeks and bowed head.</p>

<p>Baron led the way into the sitting-room, Bonnie
May following. He pretended not to see or to apprehend
anything unusual. “Well, what do you
think of Sunday-school?” he began gayly.</p>

<p>“I think it’s fierce!” This took the form of an
explosion. “It wouldn’t do even for one-night
stands!”</p>

<p>Baron felt the need of an admonitory attitude.
“Bonnie May,” he said, “you should have discovered
that it wasn’t a play. It was something real.
It’s a place where people go to help each other.”</p>

<p>“They certainly need help all right enough.”
This with a quite unlovely jeering laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“I wonder what you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I meant the same thing you meant
yourself.”</p>

<p>Baron paused, frowning. “I meant,” he explained
patiently, “that they are people who want
to be as good as they can, and who want to give
one another encouragement.”</p>

<p>The child was conscious of his wish to be conciliatory.
She tried to restrain herself. “Well,”
she asked, “if they want to be good, why don’t
they just <i>be</i> good? What’s the use of worrying
about it?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it isn’t quite so simple a matter as
all that.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May’s wrath arose in spite of herself.
She was recalling certain indignities. “I don’t see
anything in it but a bum performance. Do you
know what I think they go there for?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m trying to find out.”</p>

<p>“I think they go there to watch each other—to
find out something bad about each other.”</p>

<p>“Bonnie May!”</p>

<p>“I do! And I’ve had pretty near enough, too.
You asked me and I told you. You’re all asking
me to do things, and asking me questions; and
then if I don’t agree with you in every way I’m
wrong. That may look all right to you, but it
doesn’t to me. If I’ve got to take everything, I
mean to be on my way.”</p>

<p>Baron remained silent a full minute. When he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
spoke again his voice was persuasive, gentle. “I’m
anxious to understand your difficulties,” he said.
“I’m anxious to have you understand ours. I’m
sorry I criticised you. I’m sure you mean to be
fair.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a light of gratitude in
her eyes, a quiver of emotion passing over her face.
She had an intense desire to justify herself—at
least to him.</p>

<p>“Do you know what was the first thing they
asked me?”</p>

<p>“Your name, probably.”</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Shepard told them that. <i>They asked
me if I was a good little girl!</i>”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see any harm in that. Why
shouldn’t they have asked you?”</p>

<p>“You don’t! Do you suppose that I was going
to tell them that I was—or that I wasn’t? What
nonsense! Are you ‘a good young man’? How
does a question like that sound?”</p>

<p>Baron pondered. “Well—” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t stand it. I asked her if she
was ‘a good old woman’—and the frowzy old thing
stared at me just as ugly! She walked way down
into the parquet without looking back. She’d
been grinning when she asked me. I’ll bet she
won’t grin like that very soon again.”</p>

<p>Baron walked to the window and looked out
dully, to gain time.</p>

<p>How extraordinary the child’s attitude was! And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
yet.... He could understand that she might
have been the only child in the troupe with which
she travelled, and that her older companions,
weary of mimicry and make-believe when their
work was done, might have employed very frank,
mature speech toward each other and their young
companion.</p>

<p>He turned away from the window with a sigh.
“Won’t you take my word for it, Bonnie May,
that these people mean well, and that one should
speak of them with respect, even if one cannot
speak of them with affection?”</p>

<p>“But they don’t mean well. What’s the good
of stalling?” She turned until her back was toward
him, and sat so, her cheek in her hand, and her
whole body eloquent of discouragement.</p>

<p>An instant later she turned toward him with
the first evidence of surrender she had shown.
Her chin quivered and her eyes were filled with
misery. “Did you tell the man where I was, so
they can come for me if they want me?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Here spoke the child, Baron thought. His resentment
fled instantly. “Truly I did,” he assured
her. “I have been doing everything I could
think of to help. I want you to believe that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do; but you all put too much on me.
I want to go back to where things are real——”</p>

<p>“Real, child? The theatre, and plays, and make-believe
every day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“It’s the only thing that’s real. You’d know
that if you were an artist. It means what’s true—that’s
what it means. Do you mean to tell me
there’s anything real in all the putting on here in
this house—the way you hide what you mean and
what you believe and what you want? Here’s
where the make-believe is: just a mean make-believe
that nothing comes of. The theatre has a
make-believe that everybody understands, and so
it really isn’t a make-believe, and something good
and true comes of it.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were flashing. Her hands had been
clasped while she spoke until she came to the final
clause. Then she thrust her arms forward as if
she would grasp the good and true thing which
came of the make-believe she had defended.</p>

<p>When Baron spoke again his words came slowly.
“Bonnie May,” he said, “I wish that you and I
might try, like good friends, to understand each
other, and not to say or think anything bitter or
unkind. Maybe there will be things I can teach
you. I’m sure there are things you can teach me!
And the others ... I honestly believe that when
we all get better acquainted we’ll love one another
truly.”</p>

<p>She hung her head pensively a moment, and
then, suddenly, she laughed heartily, ecstatically.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, vaguely troubled.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking it’s certainly a pretty kettle of
fish I’ve got into. That’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“You know I don’t quite understand that.”</p>

<p>“The Sunday-school, I mean, and your mother,
and everything. They put me in with a lot of children”—this
somewhat scornfully—“and a sort of
leading lady asked us riddles—is that what you call
them? One of them was: ‘How long did it take
to make the world?’”</p>

<p>“But that wasn’t a riddle.”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever it was; and they caught one
Smart Alec. She said, ‘Forty days and forty nights,’
and they all laughed—so you could see it was just
a catch. As if anybody knew! That was the only
fun I could see to the whole performance, and it
sounded like Rube fun at that. One odious little
creature looked at my dress a long time. Then she
said: ‘I’ve got a <i>new</i> dress.’ Another looked at me
and sniffed, and sniffed, and sniffed. She wrinkled
her nose and lifted her lip every time she sniffed.
It was like a kind of signal. Then she said: ‘My
papa has got a big store, and we’ve got a horse and
buggy.’ She sniffed again and looked just as spiteful!
I had to get back at that one. ‘Don’t cry,
little one,’ I said. ‘Wait until it’s a pretty day
and I’ll come around and take you out in my automobile.’”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t any automobile!”</p>

<p>“That,” with great emphasis, “doesn’t make
any difference. There’s no harm in stringing people
of a certain kind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bonnie May!” cried Baron reproachfully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and with quickly restored calm he added: “Surely
one should tell the truth!”</p>

<p>“Yes, one should, if two would. But you can’t
afford to show your hand to every Bedelia that
gets into your troupe. No, you can’t,” she repeated
defiantly, reading the pained look in his eyes.</p>

<p>Baron knew that he should have expressed his
disapproval of such a vagrant philosophy as this;
but before he had time to frame a tactful response
the child continued:</p>

<p>“Then the leading lady turned to me, thinking
up another question. I made up my mind to be
on hand if I had to sleep in the wings. ‘Why were
Adam and Eve driven out of the garden?’ was
mine. I said: ‘Because they couldn’t make good!’
She looked puzzled, and I patted her on the knee.
‘You can’t put over anything on me,’ I said. I
think I shouted it. That stopped the whole show
for a minute, and an old character man up near
the stage got up and said: ‘A little less noise,
please.’ Then your mother came back.” (Baron
had anticipated this detail.) “She had been taking
the leading part in a little sketch up in front.”
(Teaching her class, Baron reflected, and smiled
wryly in spite of himself.) “She had got through
with her musical turn, and—well, I don’t want to
talk about her. She told me I must sit still and
listen to what the others said. Why? I’d like to
know. I couldn’t agree with her at all. I told
her I was a professional and didn’t expect to pick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
up anything from a lot of amateurs. And then,”
she added dejectedly, “the trouble began.”</p>

<p>Baron groaned. He had hoped the worst had
been told. What in the world was there to follow?</p>

<p>“Your mother,” resumed Bonnie May, “spoke
to the woman who had been asking questions.
She said—so that the children could hear every
word—‘She’s a poor little thing who’s had no
bringing up. She’ll have to learn how to behave.’”</p>

<p>She hung her head in shame at the recollection
of this. For the moment she seemed unwilling to
proceed.</p>

<p>“And what happened then?” Baron asked persuasively.</p>

<p>“Oh—I was getting—rattled! She had no right
to work in a line like that.”</p>

<p>“But what did you do?”</p>

<p>“I told her.... You know I <i>am</i> sorry, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d rather not tell me?”</p>

<p>“You’d better know. I told her that when it
came to doing the nasty stuff I had seen pupils
from the dramatic schools that looked like headliners
compared with her.”</p>

<p>Baron stiffened. “Goodness! You couldn’t
have said that!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. And I didn’t have to wait to hear
from any prompter, either. And she—you know
she won’t take anything. The way she looked!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
She said she was glad to say she didn’t have any
idea what I was talking about. Just a stall, you
know. Oh, these good people! She called Flora
and said I was to be taken into a corner, and that
I was to sit there until we went home. And Flora
led me into a corner and the others looked back
as if they were afraid of me. They all sang after
a while—a kind of ensemble affair. Flora held the
music over and invited me to sing. I told her
musical turns were not in my line. She just kept
on holding the music for me—honestly, she’s the
dearest thing!—and singing herself. It was a crime,
the noise she made. Isn’t it awful when people
try to sing and can’t? As if they had to. Why do
they do it? I felt like screaming to her to stop.
But she looked as if she might be dreaming, and
I thought if anybody could dream in that terrible
place it would be a crime to wake them, even if
they did make a noise. They had an intermission,
and then a man down in front delivered a monologue....
Oh, me! Talk about the moving-picture
shows! Why, they’re <i>artistic</i>....”</p>

<p>What, Baron wondered, was one to say to a
child who talked in such a fashion?</p>

<p>Nothing—nothing at all. He groaned. Then,
to his great relief, Flora appeared.</p>

<p>“Dinner is ready,” she said, standing in the
doorway. There was a flush on her cheeks and an
odd smile on her lips.</p>

<p>Baron took Bonnie May by the hand—he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
not quite understand the impulse which prompted
him to do so—and led her into the dining-room.</p>

<p>He saw that she bore her face aloft, with a painful
effort at unconcern. He was glad that she was
given a place next to him, with the elder Baron on
her right, and Flora across the table from her.</p>

<p>He was dismayed to note that his mother was
quite beside herself. He had expected a certain
amount of irritation, of chagrin, but not this ominous,
pallid silence. She avoided her son’s eyes, and
this meant, of course, that her wrath would sooner
or later be visited upon his head.</p>

<p>He sighed with discouragement. He realized
sadly that his mother’s heaviest crosses had always
come to her from such trivial causes! She was
oddly childish—just as Bonnie May was strangely
unchildlike. Still, she had all the traditions of
propriety, of a rule-made demeanor, behind her.
Strange that she could not have risen to the difficulty
that had confronted her, and emerged from
a petty predicament without so much of loss!</p>

<p>The meal progressed in a constrained silence.
Bonnie May concerned herself with her napkin;
she admired the design on the china; she appeared
to appraise the dishes with the care of an epicure.
And at last, unfortunately, she spoke.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, Mr. Baron”—to the master
of the house—“that it is a pretty custom to converse
while at table?”</p>

<p>Mr. Baron coughed. He was keenly aware that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
something had gone wrong; he was shrewd enough
to surmise that Bonnie May had offended. But
he was in the position of the passenger below decks
who senses an abnormal atmosphere but who is
unadvised as to the nature of the storm.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m not a very reliable hand at
small talk,” he said guardedly. “I think my idea
is that you ought to talk when you have something
to say.”</p>

<p>“Very good!” agreed Bonnie May, nodding
brightly. She patted her lips daintily with the corner
of her napkin. “Only it seems like chickens
eating when you don’t talk. The noises make you
nervous. I should think anything would get by,
even if you talked about the weather. Otherwise
it seems just like machinery at work. Rather
messy machinery, too.”</p>

<p>Baron seized an oar. “Perhaps when people are
thoughtful, or possibly troubled, it is a mark of
good taste not to try to draw them into a conversation.”
He said this airily, as if it could not possibly
apply to the present occasion.</p>

<p>“A very good idea!” admitted Bonnie May,
quite obviously playing the part of one who makes
of conversation a fine art. “But isn’t it also true
that people who are troubled ought to hide it, for
the sake of others, and not be a sort of—oh, a wet
blanket?”</p>

<p>The elder Baron’s eyes twinkled in a small, hidden
way, and Flora tried to smile. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
something quite hopefully audacious in the child’s
behavior.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Baron stiffened and stared. “Good
gracious!” she exclaimed. After which she stirred
her coffee with so much vigor that a little of it ran
over into the saucer, and even the spotless table-cloth
was menaced.</p>

<p>Baron undertook a somewhat sterner strategy.
He felt that he really must not permit the guest to
add to her offenses against his mother.</p>

<p>“It might be sensible not to talk too much until
a closer acquaintance is formed,” he suggested with
something of finality in his tone.</p>

<p>But Bonnie May was not to be checked. “A
very good thought, too,” she admitted, “but you
can’t get better acquainted without exchanging
ideas—and of course talking is the only way.”</p>

<p>Baron leaned back in his chair with a movement
resembling a collapse. Hadn’t Thornburg said
something about a white elephant?</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be fine if everybody wore a badge,
or something, so that you would know just how
they wanted to be taken?” A meticulous enthusiasm
was becoming apparent. Mrs. Baron was
sitting very erect—a sophisticated, scornful audience,
as she seemed to Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“Absurd!” was Baron’s comment.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. You pretty near know
without any badges. You can tell the—the mixers,
and the highbrows. I mean when they are the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
thing—people worth while. I would know you for
a mixer easy enough. I don’t mean careless, you
know; but willing to loosen up a little if people
went at you in the right way. And Flora would
be a mixer, too—a nice, friendly mixer, as long as
people behaved.” Here she turned with a heroic,
friendly appeal to Mrs. Baron. “And Mrs. Baron
would be one of the fine, sure-enough highbrows.”</p>

<p>“I think,” began Mrs. Baron, suddenly possessed
of an ominous calm; but the guest made an
earnest plea.</p>

<p>“Oh, please let me finish!” she begged.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mrs. Baron, “you may—finish.”</p>

<p>“You know I understand about your part in
that entertainment this morning. <i>You</i> don’t belong
in that crowd. It’s like the queen who kissed
the soldier. She was high enough up to do it and
get away with it.” She placed her elbows on the
table and beamed upon Mrs. Baron with a look so
sweetly taunting, and so obviously conciliatory,
that the others dared to hope the very audacity
of it would succeed. “Now don’t deny,” she continued,
shaking an accusing finger at Mrs. Baron
and smiling angelically, “that you’re just a nice,
sure-enough, first-class highbrow!”</p>

<p>It was done with such innocent intention, and
with so much skill, that all the members of Mrs.
Baron’s family turned their faces toward her smilingly,
appealingly, inquiringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>But alas! Mrs. Baron failed to rise to the occasion.
She was being ridiculed—by a child!—and
her children and her husband were countenancing
the outrage. Her composure vanished again.</p>

<p>She pushed her chair back from the table angrily.
Her napkin fell to the floor; she grasped the edge
of the table with both hands and stared at Bonnie
May in a towering rage.</p>

<p>“You little wretch!” she cried. “You impudent,
ungrateful little wretch! You—you brand from
the burning!”</p>

<p>She hurried from the room. In her blind anger
she bumped her shoulder against the door as she
went out, the little accident robbing her exit of
the last vestige of dignity.</p>

<p>Bonnie May was horrified, crushed. She sat,
pale and appalled, her eyes fixed on the doorway
through which Mrs. Baron had vanished.</p>

<p>Then she brought her hands together sharply
and uttered a single word:</p>

<p>“Hoo-ray!”</p>

<p>Every member of the family was electrified.</p>

<p>“Father!” expostulated Flora.</p>

<p>“Victor!” exclaimed the elder Baron.</p>

<p>And Baron, shaking his head sadly, murmured:</p>

<p>“Bonnie May! Bonnie May!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE WHITE ELEPHANT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Baron</span> “took to her room,” as the saying is.
For an hour or more she might have been, to all
intents and purposes, in some far country.</p>

<p>She left an awed silence behind her.</p>

<p>“If you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go and talk to
Mrs. Shepard a while,” said Bonnie May, not without
significance. The atmosphere had become too
rarefied for her. She was turning from an inimical
clan. She was obeying that undying instinct which
impelled the cavemen of old to get their backs
toward a wall.</p>

<p>Baron, Sr., prepared to go out. He turned to
Victor and Flora as he took his leave, and his whole
being twinkled quietly. He seemed to be saying:
“Don’t ask me!”</p>

<p>Flora stole up to her mother’s room. She tapped
at the door affectionately—if one can tap at a door
affectionately.</p>

<p>A voice muffled by pillows was heard. “Making
hay,” it seemed to say. Flora frowned in perplexity.
Then her brow cleared and she smiled wistfully.
“Oh!” she interpreted, “‘Go away.’”</p>

<p>She went to Victor again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“I suppose she’ll have to go,” she said, almost
in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, certainly; yes, she’ll have to go,”
agreed Victor firmly.</p>

<p>“And yet I can’t say it’s her fault.”</p>

<p>“You might say it’s her misfortune.”</p>

<p>“Yes.... Isn’t she—wonderful!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if two people simply can’t understand
each other, that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“But <i>she</i> understands. She just talks too much.
She won’t realize that she’s only a child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use!” exclaimed Baron. He
thrust his hands into his pockets and strolled through
the house, up into the library.</p>

<p>He took down a copy of “Diana of the Crossways,”
and opened it at random, staring darkly
at words which the late Mr. Meredith never wrote:</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t she have made allowances? Why
couldn’t she have overlooked things which plainly
weren’t meant to be the least offensive?”</p>

<p>Obscurities, perhaps, but what does one expect
of Meredith?</p>

<p>He meditated long and dejectedly. And then he
heard his mother in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>He put aside his book and assumed a light, untroubled
air. “Better have it out now,” he reflected,
as he opened the door and went into the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Where is the Queen of Sheba?” asked Mrs.
Baron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Baron dropped into a chair. “You know I’m
awfully sorry, mother,” he said. There was a
singular lack of real repentance in his tone.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that. Still, you might have
taken me into your confidence before you brought
that little limb of Satan into the house. I never
heard of such a child. Never.”</p>

<p>“But you know what the circumstances
were——”</p>

<p>“Don’t go into that again. I know that you
brought her here, and that there wasn’t any excuse
for such a foolish action.”</p>

<p>“But, mother!” Baron’s face was heavy with
perplexity. “She’s such a little thing! She hasn’t
got anybody to turn to when she’s in trouble. My
goodness! I think she’s done nobly—not whimpering
once since she came into the house. She’s
probably—rattled! How would you or I behave if
we were in her shoes?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron’s eyebrows steadily mounted. “The
point is, we’re not in the slightest degree responsible
for her. I want to know how we’re going to get
rid of her.”</p>

<p>Baron had taken a chair directly in front of his
mother. Now he arose and paced the floor. When
he spoke his tone was crisp almost to sharpness.</p>

<p>“It isn’t any more difficult now than it was yesterday,”
he said. “I can turn her over to the
police.”</p>

<p>Something in his manner startled his mother.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
She flushed quickly. “That’s just like you,” she
protested. “What do you suppose people would
say if we turned a motherless child over to the
police? You ought to see that you’ve forced a
responsibility on me!”</p>

<p>“Well, I should think it would be a question of
what your own conscience says. As for ‘people,’
I don’t see why anybody need know anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“And the newspapers and everything? Of course
they would—everything.”</p>

<p>“I could ask Thornburg to take her. He offered
to help. I have an idea he’d be only too glad to
have her.”</p>

<p>“The theatre man—yes. And he’d dress her up
in a fancy-ball costume, and encourage her in her
brazen ways, and she’d be utterly shameless by
the time she got to be a young woman.”</p>

<p>Baron sat down again with decision. “Mother,
don’t!” he exclaimed. “Thornburg isn’t that
kind at all. He’d—he’d probably try to get at her
point of view now and then, and he might allow
her to have certain liberties. I think he’s broad
enough to want her to be good without insisting
upon her being miserable!”</p>

<p>“Victor Baron!” warned his mother, and then
she added with decision: “Then you’d better get
him to take her—and the sooner the better.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right. To-morrow. I’ll call
on him at his office to-morrow. I’ve never met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
his family. I’d consider it an intrusion to go to
his house to-day, whether he did or not.”</p>

<p>This, of course, was spoken disagreeably, and
Mrs. Baron resented it. “You’re very obliging,
I’m sure,” she said. “But after what I’ve gone
through I’ve no doubt I can wait until to-morrow.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“No, it’s not that she has disappointed me,”
responded Baron to a question by Thornburg the
next morning.</p>

<p>They were sitting in the manager’s office, and
Baron had realized too late that he should have
waited until after luncheon, or for some other more
auspicious occasion, to have a confidential talk
with Thornburg. There were frequent interruptions,
and the manager had his mind upon the complicated
business of amusement purveying, rather
than upon the welfare of a waif who, as he conceived
it, had become the hobby of a somewhat
eccentric young man. A special rehearsal was in
progress in the theatre, and the voice of the stage-manager,
lifted in anger, occasionally reached
them. It was a warm morning, and many doors
were open.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” Baron resumed, “I didn’t foresee
the—the complications. My mother has taken
them into account, and it’s her decision, rather
than mine, that we ought to give her up.”</p>

<p>Thornburg turned hurriedly to examine, and
then to approve, the underline for a gorgeous poster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
of highly impressionistic design, which one of his
employees had placed before him. When he turned
to Baron again he presented the appearance of one
who has lost the thread of a conversation.</p>

<p>“We were saying—oh, yes. You’ve got enough
of—of what’s her name. Well, what’s your impression
of her, now that you’ve had time to look
her over?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t changed my mind at all. I like her.”</p>

<p>“The family made a row?”</p>

<p>Baron answered evasively. “It isn’t quite a
question of liking. It’s something like trying to
keep a canary in a suitcase, or putting a lamb or
a kitten into harness.”</p>

<p>Thornburg smiled. “Tell me just how she fails
to square with the—the domestic virtues,” he said.</p>

<p>“Her way of saying things—her views—she is
so wholly unconventional,” said Baron haltingly.
“She doesn’t stand in awe of her superiors. She
expresses her ideas with—well, with perfect liberty.
You know children aren’t supposed to be like that.
At least my mother takes that view of the case.”</p>

<p>He so plainly had little or no sympathy with the
argument he made that Thornburg looked at him
keenly.</p>

<p>“I see. She scratches the paint off!” interpreted
the manager. He smiled upon Baron exultingly.</p>

<p>“You might put it so,” agreed Baron, to whom
the words were highly offensive. What right had
Thornburg to speak contemptuously of the things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
which his family—and their kind—represented?
He proceeded coldly. “I understood that you
felt some measure of responsibility. I thought
perhaps you might be willing to take her, in case
we decided it would be difficult for us to keep
her.”</p>

<p>The manager pretended not to note the aloofness
of the other’s tone. “Now, if it were a matter
of expense—” he began.</p>

<p>“It isn’t. She doesn’t seem at home with us. I
think that states the whole case.”</p>

<p>“How could she feel at home in the short time
she’s been with you?”</p>

<p>“Then I might put it this way: She doesn’t
seem congenial.”</p>

<p>“Of course that’s different. That seems to leave
me out, as near as I can see.”</p>

<p>“You mean,” said Baron, “you wouldn’t care
to assume the responsibility for her?”</p>

<p>“Why should I?” demanded Thornburg bluntly.
He glared at Baron resentfully.</p>

<p>“You’re quite right, certainly. I seem to have
had the impression——”</p>

<p>“I have an idea she’s doing better with you
than she would anywhere else, anyway,” continued
Thornburg in milder tones. “Why not give her
her place and make her stay in it? I can’t understand
a family of grown people throwing up their
hands to a baby!”</p>

<p>“I merely wanted to get your views,” said Baron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
stiffly as he rose to go. “I didn’t care to send for
the police until——”</p>

<p>Thornburg got up, too. “Don’t understand that
I wash my hands of her,” he hastened to say. “It
might not hurt me any for the public to know that
I didn’t do anything, under the circumstances,
but it would certainly be a boost for me to have
it known that I went out of my way to do a good
deed. Of course if you <i>won’t</i> keep her——”</p>

<p>Baron turned and looked at him and waited.</p>

<p>“Look here, Baron, I’m going to be frank with
you. When you took her home, I was sore at you.
Especially after you told me something about her.
I like them—children, I mean. You had taken
her off my premises. I thought about the big house
I’ve got, and not a child in it, and never to be, and
I figured I might as well have taken her myself.
But there’s difficulties.” His expression became
troubled. “Once before I tried to take a child into
the house and Mrs. Thornburg objected. It was
my own child, too.” He paused. “You know I’ve
been married twice.”</p>

<p>Baron’s thoughts went back a few years to the
somewhat unpleasant story of Thornburg’s divorce
from an actress with whom he had spent only a
little more than one troubled year. The facts had
been public property. He made no reply.</p>

<p>Thornburg continued: “I’m in doubt as to how
my wife would look at it if I suggested that I’d
like to bring this waif home. Of course, it’s just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
possible she might not want to take a child of mine,
and still be willing to take in some outsider. You
know what strange creatures women are.”</p>

<p>Baron waited. Was Thornburg being quite frank
with him—at last?</p>

<p>“You see the difficulty. The—the wife is likely
to suspect that Bonnie May is the same little girl
I wanted to bring home before—that she’s mine.
She never saw the little daughter. I’d have to be
careful not to make her suspicious.”</p>

<p>“But the circumstances ... I don’t see how
she could suspect anything,” argued Baron.</p>

<p>“Not if I don’t seem too much interested. That’s
the point. I’ll tell you, Baron—you come out and
see us. Me and my wife. Come to-night. State
the case to us together. Tell the plain truth. Explain
how you got hold of Bonnie May, and tell
my wife your people have changed their minds.
That ought to make the thing clear enough.”</p>

<p>Baron, homeward bound, marvelled at Thornburg.
It seemed strange that a crude, strong man
should feel obliged to shape his deeds to please
an ungracious, suspicious wife. He felt sorry for
him, too. He seemed to be one of those blunderers
whose dealings with women are always bewildering,
haphazard experiments.</p>

<p>He had promised to call that evening—to lend
his aid to the manager. It was the sensible thing
to do, of course. They had to get rid of Bonnie
May. Nothing was to be gained by debating that
point any further. And yet....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>When he reached home he was hoping that his
mother might, on some ground or other, have
changed her mind.</p>

<p>He speedily learned that she had done nothing
of the kind.</p>

<p>Indeed, matters were a little more at cross-purposes
than they had been the night before. Mrs.
Baron had tried again to make a dress for the
fastidious guest, accepting certain of Flora’s suggestions,
and the result of the experiment hadn’t
been at all gratifying.</p>

<p>Baron received the first report of the matter
from Bonnie May, who was waiting for him at the
foot of the stairs when he entered the house.</p>

<p>“You will please make no unkind remarks about
my new dress,” she began, assuming the attitude
of a fencer, and slowly turning around.</p>

<p>The subject—and the child’s frivolous manner—irritated
Baron. “Really, I think it’s very pretty
and suitable,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not at all. It’s neither pretty nor suitable—though
both words mean about the same thing,
when it comes to a dress. But it’s a great improvement
on that first thing. I told your mother that.
I told her I’d wear it until I got something better.”</p>

<p>Baron sighed. “What did she say to that?”</p>

<p>“She was offended, of course. But what was I
to do? I can’t see that I’m to blame.”</p>

<p>“But can’t you see that mother is doing the best
she can for you, and that you ought to be grateful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“I see what you mean. But I believe in having
an understanding from the beginning. She’s got
her ideas, and I’ve got mine. She believes you’re
Satan’s if you look pretty—or something like that.
And I believe you ought to be Satan’s if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“But you do look—pretty.” Baron spoke the
last word ungraciously. He was trying to believe
he would not care much longer what turn affairs
took—that he would have forgotten the whole
thing in another day or two.</p>

<p>He found his mother up-stairs.</p>

<p>“Well—any change for the better?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. That depends entirely
upon what arrangements you have made.”</p>

<p>“I think Thornburg will take her. He’s got to
do a little planning.”</p>

<p>“People sometimes do before they bring strange
children into their houses,” Mrs. Baron retorted.</p>

<p>Baron realized that his mother was becoming
more successful with her sarcasm. He passed into
the library. A mischievous impulse seized him—the
fruit of that last fling of his mother’s. He called
back over his shoulder. “If the perverse little
thing is quite unendurable, you might lock her up
in the attic and feed her on bread and water until
she leaves.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron stared after him, dumfounded.
“I’ll do nothing of the sort!” she exclaimed. “She
shall not be treated unkindly, as you ought to
know. We owe that much to ourselves.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>HOW A CONVEYANCE CAME FOR BONNIE MAY—AND
HOW IT WENT AWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">True</span> to his promise, Baron set aside that evening
to call on the Thornburgs.</p>

<p>As he emerged from the vestibule and stood for
a moment on the top step he noted that the familiar
conflict between the departing daylight and the long
files of street-lamps up and down the avenue was
being waged. In the country, no doubt, this hour
would be regarded as a part of the day; but in the
city it was being drawn ruthlessly into the maw of
night. There was never any twilight on the avenue.</p>

<p>Already countless thousands of people had had
dinner, and were thronging the avenue in that
restless march which is called the pursuit of pleasure.</p>

<p>He slipped into the human current and disappeared
just a moment too soon to observe that an
automobile swerved out from its course and drew
up in front of the mansion.</p>

<p>A youthful-looking old lady with snowy hair
and with small, neatly gloved hands, pushed open
the door and emerged. With the manner of one
who repeats a request she paused and turned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Do come in, Colonel,” she called into the
shadowy recesses of the car.</p>

<p>A gray, imposing-appearing man with a good
deal of vitality still showing in his eyes and complexion
smiled back at her inscrutably. “Go on,”
he said, tucking his cigar beneath the grizzled
stubble on his upper lip, and bringing his hand
down with a large gesture of leisurely contentment.
“You’ll be all right. I don’t mind waiting.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Harrod proceeded alone to make her
call.</p>

<p>By the most casual chance Mrs. Baron was
standing at her sitting-room window when the car
stopped before the house, and when she perceived
that it was Mrs. Harrod—Amelia Harrod, as she
thought of her—who was crossing the sidewalk,
she underwent a very remarkable transformation.</p>

<p>So complete a transformation, indeed, that Bonnie
May, who was somewhat covertly observing
her, sprang softly to her feet and became all attention.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron’s face flushed—the child could see
the heightened color in one cheek—and her whole
attitude expressed an unwonted eagerness, a childish
delight.</p>

<p>The truth was that Mrs. Harrod was one of the
old friends who had seemed to Mrs. Baron to be
of the deserters—one whose revised visiting list
did not include the Barons. And they had been
girls together, and intimates throughout their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
married lives—until the neighborhood had moved
away, so to speak, and the Barons had remained.</p>

<p>It is true that, despite Mrs. Baron’s fancies,
Mrs. Harrod had remained a fond and loyal friend,
though she had reached an age when social obligations,
in their more trivial forms, were not as easily
met as they had been in earlier years. And it may
also be true that something of constraint had arisen
between the two during the past year or so, owing
to Mrs. Baron’s belief that she was being studiously
neglected, and to Mrs. Harrod’s fear that her old
friend was growing old ungracefully and unhappily.</p>

<p>Then, too, the Harrods had money. Colonel
Harrod had never permitted his family’s social
standing to interfere with his money-making. On
the contrary. The Barons were unable to say of
the Harrods: “Oh, yes, they have <i>money</i>,” as
they said of a good many other families. For the
Harrods had everything else, too.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Amelia!” exclaimed Mrs. Baron, withdrawing
her eyes from the street. She gave herself
a quick, critical survey, and put her hands to her
hair, and hurried toward her room in a state of delighted
agitation.</p>

<p>She had not given a thought to Bonnie May.
She did not know that the child slipped eagerly
from the room and hurried down the stairs.</p>

<p>Bonnie May was, indeed, greatly in need of a
diversion of some sort. Not a word had been said
to her touching the clash that had occurred at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
table during the Sunday dinner. She did not know
that the machinery necessary to her removal from
the mansion had been set in motion; but she had
a vague sense of a sort of rising inflection in the atmosphere,
as if necessary adjustments were in the
making. Perhaps her state of mind was a good deal
like that of a sailor who voyages in waters which
are known to be mined.</p>

<p>However, she liked to go to the door to admit
visitors, in any case. There may have been, latent
in her nature, a strong housekeeping instinct. Or,
perhaps, there seemed a certain form of drama in
opening the door to persons unknown—in meeting,
in this manner, persons who were for the time
being her “opposites.” She assured herself that
she was saving Mrs. Shepard from the trouble of
responding from the kitchen; though she realized
clearly enough that she was actuated partly by a
love of excitement, of encounters with various
types of human beings.</p>

<p>On the present occasion she had opened the door
and stepped aside, smiling, before Mrs. Harrod had
had time to touch the bell.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said. And when the visitor had
entered she closed the door softly. “Will you wait
until I make a light?” she asked. “I’m afraid
we’ve all forgotten about the light.” The lower
rooms had become quite gloomy.</p>

<p>She had climbed upon a chair in the drawing-room,
and touched a match to the gas-burner before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
she could be questioned or assisted, and for the
moment the caller was only thinking how peculiar
it was that the Barons went on relying upon gas,
when electricity was so much more convenient.</p>

<p>“Please have a seat,” Bonnie May added, “while
I call Mrs. Baron.” She turned toward the hall.
“Shall I say who it is?” she asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrod had not taken a seat. When the
light filled the room child and woman confronted
each other, the child deferential, the woman smiling
with an odd sort of tenderness.</p>

<p>“Who <i>are</i> you?” asked the visitor. Her eyes
were beaming; the curve of her lips was like a
declaration of love.</p>

<p>“I’m Bonnie May.” The child advanced and
held out her hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrod pondered. “You’re not a—relative?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. A—guest, I think. Nothing more
than that.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrod drew a chair toward her without
removing her eyes from the child’s face. “Do
sit down a minute and talk to me,” she said. “We
can let Mrs. Baron know afterward. A guest?
But you don’t visit here often?”</p>

<p>“This is my first visit. You see, I have so little
time for visiting. I happen not to have any—any
other engagement just now. I was very glad to
come here for—for a while.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t known the Barons long, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“In a way, no. But you know you feel you’ve
always known really lovely people. Don’t you
feel that way?” She inclined her head a little;
her lips were slightly parted; her color arose. She
was trying very earnestly to meet this impressive
person upon an equal footing.</p>

<p>“I think you’re quite right. And—how did you
meet them? I hope you don’t mind my asking
questions?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. I met Mr. Victor at a—a
kind of reception he was attending. He was lovely
to me. He asked me to meet his mother.”</p>

<p>“How simple! And so you called?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is, Mr. Victor came and—and
brought me. It was much pleasanter, his bringing
me.”</p>

<p>She had wriggled up into a chair and was keeping
clear, earnest eyes upon the visitor. She was recalling
Mrs. Baron’s agitation, and she was drawing
conclusions which were very far from being
wholly wrong.</p>

<p>“I think Victor’s a charming young gentleman,”
declared Mrs. Harrod. “He’s always doing something—nice.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Bonnie May. She had observed
that the visitor paused before she said
“nice.” Her eyes were alertly studying Mrs.
Harrod’s face.</p>

<p>“And your name is Bonnie May. Is that the
full name, or——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“Yes, that’s the full name.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrod pondered. “You’re not of the
Prof. Mays, are you?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m of—of professional people. I’m not
sure I’m of the Mays you’re thinking about.” She
edged herself from her chair uneasily. “I hope I
haven’t forgotten myself,” she added. “I’m sure
I should have let Mrs. Baron know you are here.
I think you didn’t say what the name is?”</p>

<p>“I’m Mrs. Harrod. I hope you’ll remember. I
would be glad if you’d be a friend of mine, too.”</p>

<p>The child’s dilemma, whatever it had been, was
past. She smiled almost radiantly. “I’m very
glad to have met you, Mrs. Harrod,” she said.
She advanced and extended her hand again. “I
truly hope I’ll have the pleasure of meeting you
again.”</p>

<p>Then she was off up the stairs, walking sedately.
It had meant much to her that this nice woman,
who was clearly not of the profession, had talked
to her without patronizing her, without “talking
down” to her.</p>

<p>A strange timidity overwhelmed her when she
appeared at Mrs. Baron’s door. “It’s Mrs. Harrod,”
she said, and there was a slight catch in her
voice. “I mean, Mrs. Harrod has called. I let
her in.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron, standing in her doorway, was fixing
an old-fashioned brooch in place. She flushed and
there was swift mistrust in her eyes. “Oh!” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
cried weakly. The sound was almost like a moan.
“I thought Mrs. Shepard——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell her I was—I didn’t tell her who I
was. I thought you would rather I didn’t. I was
just nice to her, and she was nice to me.”</p>

<p>She hurried away, then, because she wanted to
be by herself. For some reason which she could
not understand tears were beginning to start from
her eyes. Mrs. Baron had not been angry, this
time. She had seemed to be ashamed!</p>

<p>She did not know that the old gentlewoman
looked after her with a startled, almost guilty expression
which gave place to swift contrition and
tenderness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron did not descend the stairs. She was
about to do so when Mrs. Harrod appeared in the
lower hall.</p>

<p>“Don’t come down!” called the latter. “I mean
to have my visit with you in your sitting-room.”
She was climbing the stairs. “I don’t intend to
be treated like a stranger, even if I haven’t been
able to come for such a long time.” Shadows and
restraints seemed to be vanishing utterly before
that advancing friendly presence. And at the top
of the flight of stairs she drew a deep breath and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Emily Boone, <i>who</i> is that child?” She took
both Mrs. Baron’s hands and kissed her. “I told
the colonel I simply wouldn’t go by without stopping.
He had an idea we ought to go to see—what’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> 
the name of the play? I can’t remember.
It gave me a chance to stop. I seem never to have
the opportunity any more. But do tell me. About
the child, I mean. Do you know, I’ve never seen
such a perfect little human being in my life! She’s
so lovely, and so honest, and so unspoiled. <i>Who</i> is
she?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron felt many waters lift and pass. Bonnie
May hadn’t done anything scandalous, evidently.
And here was her old friend as expansive, as cheerfully
outspoken as in the days of long ago.</p>

<p>She found herself responding happily, lightly.</p>

<p>“A little protégée of Victor’s,” she said. “You
know what a discoverer he is?” They had entered
the sitting-room. Mrs. Baron was thinking again
how good it was to have the old bond restored, the
old friend’s voice awaking a thousand pleasant
memories.</p>

<p>But as Mrs. Harrod took a seat she leaned forward
without a pause. “Now do tell me about
that—that cherub of a child,” she said.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Victor Baron was experiencing
something like a surprise to discover that Thornburg,
the manager, seemed a new, a different, sort
of person, now that he was in his own home. He
had quite the air of—well, there was only one word
for it, Baron supposed—a gentleman.</p>

<p>The Thornburg home was quite as nice, even in
the indefinable ways that count most, as any home
Baron was acquainted with. There was an impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
of elegance—but not too much elegance—in
the large reception-room. There was a general impression
of softly limited illumination, of fine yet
simple furniture. The walls had a kind of pleasant
individuality, by reason of the fact that they were
sparsely—yet attractively—ornamented.</p>

<p>A grandfather’s clock imparted homeliness to
one end of the room; there was a restful suggestion
in the broad fireplace in which an enormous fern
had been installed. Baron’s glance also took in
a grand piano of a quietly subdued finish.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornburg alone seemed in some odd way
out of harmony with the fine, cordial picture in
which Baron found her. She was a frail, wistful
woman, and because her body was ailing, her mind,
too—as Baron speedily discovered—was not of the
sound, cheerful texture of her surroundings.</p>

<p>“Ah, Baron!” exclaimed Thornburg, advancing
to meet his guest as the latter was shown into the
room. “I’m glad to see you here.”</p>

<p>As he turned to his wife, to introduce the visitor,
Baron was struck by something cautious and alert
in his manner—the manner of a man who must
be constantly prepared to make allowances, to
take soundings. He presented an altogether wholesome
picture as he looked alternately at his wife
and his guest. His abundant, stubborn gray hair
was in comfortable disorder, to harmonize with
the smoking-jacket he wore, and Baron looked at
him more than once with the uncomfortable sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
of never having really known him before. He
thought, too, how this brusque, ruddy man seemed
in a strange fashion imprisoned within the radius
of an ailing wife’s influence.</p>

<p>“Mr. Baron is the man who carried that little
girl out of the theatre the other day,” explained
Thornburg. He turned again to Baron with a
casual air: “Do you find that your people still
want to let her go?”</p>

<p>He was playing a part, obviously; the part of
one who is all but indifferent. Mrs. Thornburg
scrutinized the visitor’s face closely.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe they do,” replied Baron.</p>

<p>“I’ve been talking to Mrs. Thornburg about the
case. She understands that I feel a sort of responsibility.
I think I’ve about persuaded her to
have a look at the little girl.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornburg seemed unwilling to look at her
husband while he was speaking. Baron thought
she must be concealing something. She was gazing
at him with an expression of reproach, not
wholly free from resentment.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t the child any relatives?” she asked.
She seemed to be making an effort to speak
calmly.</p>

<p>“I really can’t answer that,” said Baron. “She
seems not to have. She has told me very little
about herself, yet I believe she has told me all she
knows. She has spoken of a young woman—an
actress—she has travelled with. There doesn’t appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
to have been any one else. I believe she never
has had a home.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornburg withdrew her gaze from him.
She concerned herself with the rings on her thin,
white fingers. “How did you happen to be with
her in the theatre?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I was in one of the upper boxes. I don’t know
how she came to be there. I believe she couldn’t
find a seat anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“And you’d never seen her before?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence. Both
Thornburg and Baron were looking interestedly
at Mrs. Thornburg, who refused to lift her eyes.
“I wonder how you happened to take her to your
home?” she asked finally.</p>

<p>Baron laughed uneasily. “I’m wondering myself,”
he said. “Nobody seems to approve of what
I did. But if you could have seen her! She’s
really quite wonderful. Very pretty, you know,
and intelligent. But that isn’t it, after all. She
is so charmingly frank. I think that’s it. It’s
unusual in a child.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” agreed Mrs. Thornburg. “Unusual
in any one, I should say.”</p>

<p>“Why, perhaps it is,” agreed Baron simply.
He was not a little puzzled by something in Mrs.
Thornburg’s manner.</p>

<p>“And why don’t you want to keep her?” she
wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“We meant to. But it turns out that she and
my mother are—well, antagonistic.”</p>

<p>“That’s unfortunate, isn’t it? Please pardon
me—you see, I’m really handicapped. But—what
kind of woman is your mother?” She put the
question so softly that it did not seem offensive.</p>

<p>Baron hesitated. “Perhaps it will explain if I
say that she is elderly? There haven’t been any
children in the house for a good many years. She
believes—what is the familiar saying?—that children
ought to be seen and not heard.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornburg hesitated. “That wouldn’t be
quite the reason,” she said. “Your mother is—is
orthodox, I suspect, in her friendships and ways.
I’m sure you see what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Baron. “I think you are getting
closer to the facts than I did.”</p>

<p>A pretty, delicate hue warmed the woman’s
face, and her voice softened almost to tenderness.
“I think I know,” she went on. “The little girl
of the stage, out of some unknown place in Bohemia—she
must seem quite disturbing, hopelessly
out of harmony....”</p>

<p>“You put the case much better than I did. Yet
you know all that’s scarcely fair to Bonnie May.
She’s not really bold and impertinent, in the usual
sense of those words. She hasn’t had the kind of
training other children have. She has never associated
with other children. You can see that
instantly. She assumes that she has the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
right to her opinion that older people have to theirs.
She never means to offend. I have an idea she’s
really quite affectionate. I have an idea if you
once won her over——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornburg turned toward her husband
and leaned forward in her chair, her eyes filled
with a soft, generous impulse. When she spoke
her voice vibrated with feeling.</p>

<p>“Bring her home!” she said.</p>

<p>Baron fancied there was an expression of triumph
in the manager’s bearing. “You mean now—to-night?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Why not to-night? I’m eager to have her;
really eager, now that I’ve decided.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite simple,” declared Thornburg. “I
suppose you’ll have to—to get a few things ready?”</p>

<p>Her whole being became tremulous—she who
had had no children of her own, and who knew
nothing about them. “Nothing to-night, to speak
of. To-morrow....” She clasped her hands and
looked into vacancy, as if visions were coming to
her.</p>

<p>But Thornburg was already in an adjoining
room at the telephone, ordering his machine.</p>

<p>Baron regarded Mrs. Thornburg thoughtfully.
He was surprised and touched by her intensity.
Then she looked at him, mutely appealing. There
was a long moment during which two minds tried
to meet across a barrier of emotion and a lack of
mutual knowledge. Then Mrs. Thornburg spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“You know,” she explained, “we’ve both been disappointed,
deeply disappointed, because we hadn’t
any of our own.”</p>

<p>When Thornburg’s automobile stopped before
the Baron mansion, half an hour later that evening,
and the manager and Baron got out, something
happened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron, her gray hair stirring slightly in the
spring breeze, stood on the front steps for all the
world like an alert sentinel.</p>

<p>“Well, Victor?” she demanded, as her son advanced
toward her. Her voice was sternly challenging.</p>

<p>“This gentleman has come to take Bonnie May
away,” replied her son. He derived a certain satisfaction
from her disturbed state.</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“To her new home, with Mr. and Mrs. Thornburg.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you’ve brought that machine to
take her away to-night?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes—certainly.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can just send it away. You won’t
need it to-night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I understand, mother!”</p>

<p>Baron had approached the lowest step and
Thornburg had taken a position close to him.
Mrs. Baron, from her superior height, frowned
down upon them as if they were two kidnappers
who must be held at bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“You probably don’t,” replied Mrs. Baron. “It
isn’t necessary that you should, either. But you’ll
grasp my meaning when I tell you that child shall
not be taken away in the dead of night, as if she
were being stolen, and she shall not leave this
house until she has been decently clothed and made
ready to go. I never heard of such an outrageous
thing in my life.” She turned with fear, yet with
severity, toward Thornburg. When she spoke
again it might have seemed that she regarded the
manager as a kind of trained wolf over whom her
son might possess an influence. “Victor, tell him
to go away!” she commanded. “When I want
him to come back I’ll let you know.”</p>

<p>She turned with the air of a queen who had
been affronted. In an instant she had disappeared.
The door had been quite unmistakably slammed
behind her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>RELATES TO THE PLAYING OF PARTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> light is thrown upon the character of Victor
Baron when it is said that he was the kind of
young man who likes to sit in an attic when the
rain is falling.</p>

<p>Such a young man may possess many high virtues,
certainly; but he can scarcely hope to escape
occasional contact with what is called the world’s
cold shoulder. He is clearly not the sort of person
who knows what magic there is in the matter of
percentages and other such progressive and acquisitive
sciences.</p>

<p>We now encounter this peculiar young man in
his attic room, on an afternoon when the rain was
falling steadily.</p>

<p>Days had passed since Mrs. Baron had driven
the manager, Thornburg, from her front door.
Something like a fixed status in the case of Bonnie
May had been brought about. Seemingly, she had
become a permanent member of the Baron household.</p>

<p>Yet Baron was not happy. Having performed
his duty in solving one problem, he had now passed
on to another, an older problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>There was the fact of his aimless existence staring
him in the face; the fact that he had been home
from the university over a year now, and that as
yet he had chosen no plough to the handles of
which he meant to set his hands.</p>

<p>He did a little newspaper writing when the spirit
moved him: articles and reviews which were often
quite cordially accepted—and sometimes even urgently
solicited—but which were still subjected to
a measuring process in the accounting room of the
newspaper offices, and which were only meagrely
profitable.</p>

<p>To be sure, his needs were quite simple. He
made no contributions to the up-keep of the household.
He kept his tailor’s bills paid with a reasonable
degree of promptitude. Usually, too, he had
funds enough for books and other means of recreation.
Still, there were occasions when he had to
go to his mother for assistance, and this practise
he was compelled to contemplate with utter disfavor.</p>

<p>It is true that he never asked his mother for
Money. The Barons pronounced the word money
as if it were spelled with a capital letter, like certain
other more or less unsavory names—Lucretia
Borgia, New Caledonia, Christian Science, Prussianism,
or Twilight Sleep. He used to ask her,
when need arose, if she had any street-car-fare lying
about. And she would put her index-finger to her
forehead and meditate, and then remember suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
that there was some in her work-basket on
the centre-table, or under something or other on
the sideboard. A burglar would have had a discouraging
experience in the mansion; not because
there was never anything to steal, but because
what money there was was always placed lightly
in such unpromising places.</p>

<p>“I really ought to get down to business,” concluded
Baron, sitting in his attic—though the
phrase was inept, since business was another word
which the Barons pronounced as if it were spelled
with a capital letter.</p>

<p>The place was depressingly quiet. The houseman,
Thomason, might be in his room, which adjoined
Baron’s; but Thomason never made any
noise. He was almost uncannily quiet at all times.
The door between the two rooms was never opened.
Both opened upon the hall, and when Thomason
wished to attend to his duties he descended to the
floor below, where a back stairway afforded egress
to the lower regions where his more active interests
lay.</p>

<p>Yes, the quietude was just now quite depressing.
Sitting by an open window, Baron looked out upon
the sombre vista of back street, which was uninviting
at best, but which now presented a doubly
depressing aspect in the monotonously falling rain.</p>

<p>An intercepted picture of a small park was visible
several blocks away. The Lutheran church, whose
bell was forever tinkling a message of another time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and place, was in sight, and so was the shoulder
of a brewery.</p>

<p>Closer at hand men and women were hurrying
in various directions, seeking escape from the rain.
They had finished their day’s work and were now
going home to enjoy their well-earned bread and
meat and rest. Over there where the wind currents
of two streets met two small boys stood beneath a
dilapidated umbrella and permitted a torrent of
muddy water in the gutter to run over their bare
feet. A beer-driver, partly sheltered under the
hood of his dray, drove rumblingly over the cobblestones
toward the near-by brewery. On the ends of
passing street-cars home-going crowds were trying
to escape the falling rain.</p>

<p>All this constituted a back-street picture which
none of the Barons observed as a rule. It was the
habit of the family to confine their outlook to the
front view. But just now Baron was experiencing
a frame of mind which made the humble side of
life significant and even fascinating.</p>

<p>Still, he was glad to have his solitude invaded
when, some time later, he felt a light touch on his
shoulder. Unheard and unobserved, Bonnie May
had stolen into the room. She had “caught” him
in a brown study.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you’ve been studying your part
long enough?” she asked. She was looking at him
with cheerful comprehension.</p>

<p>“What part?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“Well, of course I don’t know exactly, except
that it would be <i>your</i> part—whatever that is.
That’s what people always do when they’re alone,
isn’t it? They think how certain words will sound,
or how they will do this or that. That’s studying
a part, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—in a way.”</p>

<p>She pulled a chair to the window, close to him,
and climbed into it. “There’s really something
funny about it,” she added with a reminiscent
manner.</p>

<p>“Funny?”</p>

<p>“I mean about people and their parts. You
know, mostly people aren’t thinking at all about
how to do their own parts better. They’re imagining
themselves in some rôle way beyond them.
When they think they are ambitious they’re mostly
just sore because somebody is doing better than
they are. It’s jealousy—not ambition. My goodness,
the little parts are important enough!”</p>

<p>Baron regarded her in silence. Then—“but
don’t you think everybody ought to want to advance?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, well—yes; but think how a production
would be if the little parts—even the populace—were
done wrong! If I had only one line, I’d want to
believe it was as important as anything in the play.”</p>

<p>Baron tried to apply that philosophy to his own
“part,” but he had to admit that the result was
not at all satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Anyway,” she added, “if you do things the
way your audience wants you to do them, I’ll bet
the big parts will come fast enough.”</p>

<p>“The audience!” echoed Baron. “I’d want a
higher standard than that. I’d want to—to play
my part the way I thought it should be done. I
wouldn’t be satisfied just with pleasing the audience.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that’s the wrong idea. I’ve seen people
like that. They never were what you’d call artists.
Believe me, the audience is the best judge.”</p>

<p>Baron, seeking for a symbol, believed there was
no hope of finding it in this. His mind wandered,
and when he brought it back to the child who sat
before him she was talking of her own problem in
a way which did not touch his at all.</p>

<p>“I think it’s the chance of my life,” she was saying,
“my being here with you all.”</p>

<p>“A chance—for what?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, to pick things up. You know I can’t always
be a Little Eva. I’ll be too old for that after
a while. And then it will be handy for me to have
a little—a little class.”</p>

<p>“Class!” exclaimed Baron. “Class?”</p>

<p>He had been arguing that the one thing wrong
with his way of thinking and living was that he
and his family had attached a silly importance to
the class idea, and that it had prevented him from
learning to be active and useful in ways that counted
in the world in which he had to live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“It’s a good thing,” defended Bonnie May.
“It’s needed in all the best plays. And you can’t
get it just by going to the wardrobe mistress, either.
It’s something that’s got to be <i>in</i> you. In order to do
it right, you’ve pretty near got to have the goods.”</p>

<p>She couldn’t understand why Baron had spoken
with such emphasis—with such resentment.</p>

<p>“Class,” mused Baron to himself. He looked
intently at this child who did not know where she
had been born—who knew nothing even about her
parentage.</p>

<p>But she had turned to a happier memory. “You
know you can’t play the part of Little Eva very
long, even when you begin quite early. And I was
just a little bit of a thing when I played it first.”
She laughed heartily. “I couldn’t even speak
plain. I used to say ‘U’kle Tom’! How they
laughed at me! ‘U’kle Tom!’ It’s really a hideous
word, isn’t it? ‘Uncle,’ and ‘aunt,’ too. You can
see that the man who framed up those words never
thought very highly of uncles and aunts. Just
compare those words with ‘father’ and ‘mother’!
Aren’t they lovely? Father!” she spoke the word
musingly. “Father!” Her body drooped forward
slightly, and her face was pitched up so that she
was gazing into space. “Beautiful words, and
mother! ... mother!” Her voice had become
a yearning whisper.</p>

<p>Baron touched her shoulders with gentle hands.
“Don’t, child!” he implored her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>She aroused herself as from a dream. Her eyes
brightened. She looked at him searchingly. “You
thought ... I believe I was, too!”</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet. “I really do intend to
pick up a lot of things while I am here,” she added
briskly. She walked across the floor. “An imitation
of a person of class,” she said. She moved
with studied elegance. “You see,” she exclaimed,
turning to him, “I can’t do it at all right! I ought
to beat that.” She returned to her starting-point.
“See if I do it any better,” she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron appeared in the doorway, but neither
Baron nor the child saw her. Again Bonnie May
crossed the room. This time she assumed a slightly
careless air, and looked airily at imaginary objects
to right and left. Her movement was slightly undulating.
She turned to Baron suddenly: “What
you have to do is to be really proud, without thinking
about it. I know how it ought to be done, but
it’s hard to get the hang of it. If you don’t get it
just right you’re likely to look like a saleslady.”
She discovered Mrs. Baron, who stood rather scornfully
in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Baron!” she exclaimed. She was
somewhat dismayed. She thought of adopting a
conciliatory course. “You could show us just
what I mean, if you would,” she said.</p>

<p>“I came to say that dinner is ready,” said Mrs.
Baron. “Could show you what?”</p>

<p>“Won’t you please come here—quite over to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
end of the room? Now please go out. We’ll come
right away.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron regarded her sternly. Bonnie May
flushed and her glance became softly appealing.
She took Mrs. Baron’s hand and patted it. “I’m
not being rude, really,” she declared. “It’s as if
we were asking you to settle a bet, you know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, please don’t be angry. If you are, it
will spoil everything.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron turned to her son. He was telegraphing
to her an earnest appeal, in which she
read an assurance that she was not to be made
ridiculous, even from the extraordinary view-point
of Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“Did you understand that dinner is ready?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother. We’ll be right down.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron left the room.</p>

<p>“Look at it! Look at it!” whispered Bonnie
May. Her hands were clasped in a worshipful ecstasy.
Her eyes seemed to retain the picture after
Mrs. Baron had disappeared. Then she turned
with swift intensity to Baron.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope she’ll care for me a little!” she
exclaimed. “She’s so—so legitimate!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>A MYSTERIOUS SEARCH BEGINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> a sky that had been rapidly clearing, a bolt
fell.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the city, in what mysterious spot
Baron could not surmise, a search for Bonnie May
began. Like a wireless message seeking persistently
for a receiving-centre, the quest of the unclaimed
child launched itself.</p>

<p>The afternoon delivery of letters at the mansion
had been made, and Bonnie May met the carrier
at the door.</p>

<p>A moment later she entered the library, where
Baron sat, and laid before him a single letter.</p>

<p>He examined postmark and inscription without
being in the least enlightened. With a pair of
scissors he cut the end from the envelope and drew
forth the single sheet it contained.</p>

<p>His glance dropped to the bottom of the sheet,
and then he sat up suddenly erect, and uttered an
unintelligible exclamation.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life he had received an
anonymous communication.</p>

<p>The thing had the merit of brevity:</p>

<p>“<i>Do not give up the child, Bonnie May, to any one
who does not present a legal claim on her.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>A disguised handwriting. This was obvious
from certain exaggerations and a lack of symmetry.</p>

<p>He replaced the missive in its envelope, and then
he took it out and read it again.</p>

<p>The thing excited him. Who could be seeking
the child, after days of silence—even of hiding?
And who could have known of his possession of
her? Again, why make a mystery of the matter?</p>

<p>He threw the puzzling words aside. People did
not pay any attention to anonymous communications,
he reflected.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he could not calm himself. He
started nervously at the sound of the telephone-bell
down in the dining-room.</p>

<p>Responding, he heard Thornburg’s voice at the
other end of the wire.</p>

<p>“Is this Baron? Say, can you come down to
my office right away?” The manager’s voice betrayed
excitement, Baron thought. Or was he
himself in an abnormal frame of mind?</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” he replied. He added: “Anything
wrong?”</p>

<p>“Why—no; no, I think not. I’ll tell you when
you get here.”</p>

<p>Something was wrong, however—Baron could
see it the moment he entered the manager’s office,
half an hour later.</p>

<p>He had to wait a little while for an audience.
Thornburg was talking to an actress—or to a woman
who had the appearance of an actress. She sat with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
her back toward the office door and did not turn.
But Thornburg, upon Baron’s entrance, made a
very obvious effort to bring the interview with this
earlier caller to an end. He seemed vastly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“What you ought to do is to get a stock engagement
somewhere,” Thornburg was saying impatiently.
“I might possibly get you in with
Abramson, out in San Francisco. He wrote me
the other day about a utility woman. I’ll look up
his letter and see if there’s anything in it. You
might come back.”</p>

<p>He arose with decision, fairly lifting the woman
to her feet by the force of peremptory example.
“About that other matter—” he moved toward
the door, clearly intimating that he wished to
finish what he had to say outside the office.</p>

<p>The woman followed; but in passing Baron she
paused, and her eyes rested upon him sharply.
There was a suggestion of suspicion in her manner,
in her glance, and Baron had the vexing sensation
of having seen her before without being able to
identify her. A furrow appeared in his forehead.
He made a determined effort to remember. No,
he couldn’t place her. She might be an actress he
had seen on the stage somewhere or other.</p>

<p>She and Thornburg passed out of the office and
the manager closed the door behind him. Baron
could still hear their voices, now lowered to an
angry whisper. Thornburg seemed to be speaking
accusingly, but Baron could not catch the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Then this one sentence, in Thornburg’s voice,
came sharply: “I tell you, you’ve worked me as
long as you’re going to!”</p>

<p>Then the manager, flushed and excited, re-entered
the office and closed the door angrily.</p>

<p>And in that moment Baron remembered: That
was the woman who had stood in the theatre, talking
in a tense fashion with the manager, the day he,
Baron, had sat up in the balcony box with Bonnie
May!</p>

<p>He had no time to ponder this fact, however.
Thornburg turned to him abruptly. “Have you
seen the <i>Times</i> to-day?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I glanced at it. Why?”</p>

<p>The manager took a copy of the paper from a
pigeonhole in his desk. “Look at that,” he directed,
handing the paper to Baron. It was folded
so that a somewhat obscure item was uppermost.</p>

<p>Baron read: “Any one having knowledge of the
whereabouts of the child calling herself Bonnie
May, and professionally known by that name, will
please communicate with X Y Z, in care of the
<i>Times</i>.”</p>

<p>Baron dropped the paper on the desk and turned
to Thornburg without speaking.</p>

<p>The manager, now strangely quiet and morose,
gazed abstractedly at the floor. “I wish,” he said
at length, “I wish she was in Tophet, or somewhere
else outside my jurisdiction.”</p>

<p>“But how do you know it is a <i>she</i>?” demanded
Baron, indicating the newspaper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“I mean Bonnie May. I don’t know anything
about that advertisement.”</p>

<p>For a moment Baron could only stare at the
manager. He was wholly at sea. He was beginning
to feel a deep resentment. He had done nothing
that a man need apologize for. By a fair enough interpretation
it might be said that he had tried to
do a good deed. And now he was being caught in
the meshes of a mystery—and Thornburg was behaving
disagreeably, unreasonably.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and tried to assume
a perfectly tranquil manner. He was determined
not to lose his head.</p>

<p>“This advertisement,” he said, “seems to solve
the problem. The writer of it may not care to take
Bonnie May to Tophet; but at least he—or she—seems
ready enough to take her off our hands. Off
my hands, I should say. What more do you
want?”</p>

<p>The manager scowled. “I don’t want anybody to
take her off your hands, nor my hands.”</p>

<p>“Why not? If they’re entitled to her——”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’re entitled to her. A child
like that.... She’s worth a lot to people who
know how to handle her. Somebody who needs
her in his business is probably trying to get hold
of her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that doesn’t sound reasonable to me at
all. Somebody has had charge of her. Somebody
brought her to the theatre. Her mother, in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
probability.” Baron tried to speak quite casually.
“Possibly her father’s somewhere about, too.”</p>

<p>Thornburg glared resentfully at the younger
man. “If her mother was about,” he demanded,
“would she have waited all this while to speak?”</p>

<p>Baron was silenced for a moment. “Well, then,”
he asked at length, “what is your sizing up of the
case?”</p>

<p>“I think she was deserted, maybe because for
the moment she was a burden. I think some tin-horn
manager is looking for her now. And here’s
another thing I know. I want her myself!”</p>

<p>“But you were just saying——”</p>

<p>“Well, then, my wife wants her. It’s the same
thing. She made up her mind, and now she won’t
change it. When I went home that night and reported
that we couldn’t have her, she began to cry.
She wouldn’t leave her bed the next morning.
She’s been sick ever since. She’ll lie for hours at
a time without saying anything but—‘I wish we
could have had the little girl.’ It’s nonsense, of
course; but you have to take things as you find
them. The doctor says I must get her interested
in something—as if the thing were perfectly simple.
If he’d ever run a theatre he’d know what it means
to get anybody interested. Well, there....” He
calmed himself suddenly and leaned toward Baron.
His next words were little more than whispered.
“You see,” he said, “I’m fond of her—of the wife.
I don’t know if you could understand how I feel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
She’s all I’ve got, and there’s a good bit of the child
about her, and she hasn’t been quite well for a long
time. She needs me to think and plan for her—to
understand her, as far as I can. You interested her
in this child. She wants her. And I want her to
have her.”</p>

<p>“That’s plain,” said Baron. He was trying not
to be too much influenced by the manager’s sudden
humility, his voicing of a need. So far as he knew,
he had his own rights in the case. And above everything
else there was to be considered Bonnie May’s
right. If it seemed best for her to remain in the
mansion, there, Baron resolved, she should remain,
until he was forced to release her. “That’s
plain,” he repeated. “I think it makes the case
simple enough. At least it makes it simpler. Why
not communicate with these people who are advertising?
If they have any claim on her you can
come to terms with them. They ought to be
glad to see her placed in a good home. If they
haven’t any claims, the sooner we know it the
better.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to pay any attention to them,”
declared Thornburg. He was sullen and stubborn
again.</p>

<p>“Well, of course it isn’t up to you,” agreed Baron
mildly. “It’s I who must do it, as of course I
shall.”</p>

<p>“That’s precisely what I don’t want you to do.
That’s why I sent for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Baron flushed. “But—” he objected.</p>

<p>“Do you know what’ll happen if you show your
hand? I’ll tell you. A lot of mountebanks will be
pouring into your house. They’ll make it look
like a third-rate booking agency. Your people
will like that!”</p>

<p>Baron could see the picture: the grotesque persons
at his door; the sallow tragedian with a bass voice
and no mentality to speak of; the low comedian,
fat and obtuse; the ingénue with big, childish eyes
and deep lines in her face; the leading lady with a
self-imposed burden of cheap jewelry. He saw, too,
the big-hearted among them, gravely kind toward
children, and with a carefully schooled yearning
for them.</p>

<p>He straightened up with a jerk. “Oh, that
wouldn’t be necessary,” he declared. “I could
correspond with them through the agency of the
newspaper. I needn’t give them my name and address
at all. I could require proper proofs before
I appeared in the matter at all personally.”</p>

<p>This idea seemed to strike Thornburg as a method
of escape from a dilemma. “Why shouldn’t I have
thought of that way myself?” he exclaimed. “I
can do it that way, of course. Better for me than
for you. More in my line, at least.”</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to think I ought to do it myself,”
objected Baron. “I really don’t see why I should
leave it to you.” Something in Thornburg’s manner
had created a suspicion in his mind. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
something too eager in the manager’s tone; there
was a hint of cunning.</p>

<p>“If I give you my word?” said Thornburg. He
was resentful, offended. His face had flamed to
the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you give me your word,” agreed Baron
lightly. “I’ve no objection. Certainly, go ahead.”
He scrutinized his stick with a long, frowning inspection.
Then he arose with decision. “I’ll leave
it to you,” he added. “Only, I want to make one
condition.”</p>

<p>“Oh—a condition! Well, what?”</p>

<p>“You’ll not take offense, Thornburg. You see,
I have certain scruples.” His mind had gone back
over several episodes, and his analysis of them
pointed unyieldingly to one plain duty. “I want
to ask you just one question, and you’re to answer
it in just a word: Yes, or No.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the question?”</p>

<p>Baron looked steadily into the other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“The woman who was here in your office when
I came in; who stood with you in the theatre that
day I took Bonnie May home——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Is she the—the former Mrs. Thornburg? Is
she the mother of Bonnie May?”</p>

<p>And Thornburg’s answer came resolutely, promptly,
in the tone of a man who tells the truth:</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<small>MR. ADDIS RECEIVES SUPPORT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Unconscious</span> that destiny had its eye upon her,
Bonnie May found increasing comfort and contentment
in her new home.</p>

<p>As a result of the delighted labors of Flora, her
wardrobe had become more complete than it had
ever been before. She developed such pride in the
possession of many garments that Flora forgot her
own needs and gave disproportionately of her time
and means to the “outfitting” of the guest whose
needs were so urgent.</p>

<p>As if for her special entertainment, unusual
things happened.</p>

<p>For example, Mr. Addis called again. And a
call from Mr. Addis became, in Bonnie May’s
drama-loving mind, the most delicious form of intrigue.
Mrs. Baron became indignant at the very
mention of Mr. Addis’s name. Flora became
quietly wistful.</p>

<p>Kneeling on a low Brussels hassock at the front
window of the upper floor one night, Bonnie May
saw the figure of a man extricate itself from the
passing current of humanity and make resolutely
for the Baron door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>She swiftly placed her finger on her lip and reflected.
“Mr. Addis!” she exclaimed in a whisper.</p>

<p>She made a supreme effort to leave the room
without appearing to have any definite purpose.
Once out of sight in the hall, however, she rushed
down the stairs, just in time to open the door before
the bell was rung. She was in an elated state.
She had the lower floor to herself, save for Mrs.
Shepard, who would be sure not to interrupt.</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Addis!” she whispered eagerly. She
promptly ushered him into the drawing-room and
quietly closed the door with an effect of being absent-minded,
rather than designing. “Please sit down,”
she said. She had the light burning immediately.</p>

<p>She drew a chair forward and stood beside it a
moment, and under her inspection Mr. Addis’s
cheeks took on even a deeper rosiness and his brown
eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“How is—my confederate?” he asked.</p>

<p>She was delighted. “That’s it,” she said. “That’s
what I want to be. Your confederate. May I?”</p>

<p>“You may,” he said with emphasis.</p>

<p>She had sat down. “You know,” she confided,
“I’m strong for what you call heart interest. If
you haven’t got anything but manners in your
show you soon find that people are patronizing the
burlesque houses. Don’t you think I’m right?”</p>

<p>Mr. Addis did not make a very pertinent response
to this. “You’re a queer little customer,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“That’s what I call favorable criticism put into
plain words. I thank you.” She added: “I want
to be friends with you if you’ll let me because I
think we can’t have the right kind of heart interest
around here unless you—unless you take a more
prominent part.”</p>

<p>Mr. Addis nodded. “That’s my idea, too. That’s
why I called. If you’ll tell Mrs. Baron I’m here,
I’ll see if I can’t get her to agree with us.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May did not stir. “Please not just yet,”
she begged. “Couldn’t we talk things over first?
If I could find out what’s wrong....” She looked
at him with pretty embarrassment.</p>

<p>“What, for instance, would you like to know?”</p>

<p>She pulled herself farther back into her chair
and reflected a moment. “Would you mind,” she
asked, “telling me how you got acquainted with
Miss Flora?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. She’s been coming to my store—to
order things—ever since she was a little girl.”</p>

<p>“Oh! your store. Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“And occasionally I’ve dropped into the church
she goes to. You know who I am, I suppose?”</p>

<p>She beamed upon him. “I may not have all the
details. Suppose you make a complete confession.”</p>

<p>He shot a dubious glance at her; then he smiled.
Bonnie May thought his teeth were quite wonderful.
“I’m the head of the Addis Stores Company.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May looked slightly dismayed.</p>

<p>“A business man,” added Mr. Addis firmly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
“I’ve admired Miss Flora a very long time. I had
chances just to be nice and polite to her. I haven’t
taken any pains to hide from her, for a year or
so——”</p>

<p>“I understand,” Bonnie May finished for him.</p>

<p>“Well, then. But the trouble is that Mrs.
Baron——”</p>

<p>“She can only see you with a pencil behind your
ear,” supplemented Bonnie May.</p>

<p>Mr. Addis laughed. “Now you have it!” he
agreed.</p>

<p>Bonnie May pondered. “You know you’re <i>not</i>
a regular-looking Romeo,” she conceded.</p>

<p>“I know that very well. But at the same
time——”</p>

<p>She gave him time to finish; then, as he seemed
to lack words, she came to his aid again: “If you
undertook to pay a lady’s travelling expenses, it
would take a pretty smooth Iago to make you do
anything nasty.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” agreed Mr. Addis with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Have you tried the—the little, unimportant
things?”</p>

<p>“As for example?”</p>

<p>“Well, just as a suggestion: you know you
weren’t carrying a stick when you came in to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that sort of thing. You see, that’s not in
my line at all. I wouldn’t know how to carry a
stick, or where to put it. I don’t see any use in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
’em except to beat off dogs, maybe—and all the
dogs like me!”</p>

<p>Bonnie May nodded. “After all, I believe you’re
right in not taking up that sort of thing. Anyway,
I wasn’t criticising. What I was saying was just—just
confederate stuff, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Would you.... Would you mind telling me
what you think about mostly? When you’re not
thinking about Miss Flora?”</p>

<p>Mr. Addis smiled quite delightedly. “Not at
all. I think of a nice home, you know. A place
out in the suburbs, with several acres of ground,
with a driveway, and—and chickens,” he concluded
somewhat lamely.</p>

<p>“Chickens!” echoed Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“Well, there would be fresh eggs, you know;
and then the look of them about the place—especially
the little ones, and roosters crowing in the
morning.”</p>

<p>She shook her head dubiously. “What else?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, such things as investments. Ground in
the new additions, where the values are going up
fast. Such things.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May put up a restraining hand. “That
will do,” she said. “Now tell me what chance you
have of seeing Flora when you—when you haven’t
got your pencil behind your ear.”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s church. I can always go to church.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
They make a real to-do over me there. They like
to come to me for subscriptions, you know.”</p>

<p>At the word church she looked at him with
quickened interest. “Did they try to put over
anything on you the first time you went there?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Not a thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny.” She put her own experiences
out of her mind. “Well,” she resumed, “why
don’t you go to church regularly and let them see
how nice and friendly you look when you haven’t
got your make-up on?”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that. But you see, it doesn’t
seem quite honest. As I understand it, church is
mostly for singing, and I couldn’t carry a tune any
more than a bird could carry a bank-account. I’d
feel like an impostor if I went.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May, sitting bolt upright in her chair,
put her hand on her heart and moved her head,
carefully erect, as far forward as possible, without
changing the attitude of her shoulders.</p>

<p>“I greet you,” she said. “I can’t sing, either.”</p>

<p>“And so going to church don’t seem to put me
in Miss Flora’s class at all.”</p>

<p>“Still,” observed Bonnie May thoughtfully,
“Flora is not one of the Original Songbird Sisters
herself.”</p>

<p>“No, but she follows along. And I never could
get the hang of the thing at all.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May laughed swiftly, and then cast a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
cautious eye at the ceiling, and checked herself.
“After all,” she said, “we’re not getting at the
real trouble, whatever it is. You know the difference
between the old families and the—the others,
is that the others talk about making money,
while the old families talk about spending it. You’re
not an old family, probably?”</p>

<p>“Well, I never talk about it, if I am. I like to
work. I like to be interested in things that everybody
else is interested in. The objection to me, I
think, is that my business happens to be groceries.
People think of soap, I suppose, and a crate of
eggs with here and there a broken one in it. Ugly
things, you know.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May shuddered. “Please don’t!” she
implored. “You must keep your mind off of it.
Your suburban-home idea is nice. But put a soft
pedal on the chickens. Think of Chinese lanterns.
Lawn-parties, I mean. Talk about <i>al fresco</i> performances
of Shakespeare and house-parties. Don’t
let anybody think about how you earn money.
Let them believe you’ve just got it. Really, it’s not
a very nice subject. If the word ‘money’ ever comes
up, just yawn and say something about not being
able to decide whether you want to spend the summer
in the Yellowstone or in the Thousand Islands.”</p>

<p>Mr. Addis shook his head. “No,” he said. “I
couldn’t put on airs. You see, I think Miss Flora
thinks enough of me as I am, and I couldn’t be
something different just to please her mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“Had you thought of the old-fashioned way—of
running away?”</p>

<p>Mr. Addis became quite serious. “Miss Flora’s
not that kind,” he said promptly. “No, I’ve got
to fight it out with—with the mother.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At this juncture Mrs. Baron, in her sitting-room,
closed the anthology with the flexible leather covers
and inclined her head slightly.</p>

<p>“Flora,” she called, “I’m sure I hear voices
down-stairs. Will you go see?”</p>

<p>Flora appeared in the doorway. “I can’t hear
anything,” she said. “Where’s Bonnie May? I
thought she was here with you.”</p>

<p>“I thought she was here, too, until just now.
She may be ‘receiving’ to-night. Of course, she
wouldn’t think it necessary to take us into her
confidence.”</p>

<p>Flora sighed softly. “I really don’t hear anybody,”
she said. “I expect she’s gone up to Victor’s
room.” A smile came to her lips as she went
down-stairs. Her mother’s petulance had been of
the sort she might be expected to manifest if her
own child had irritated her.</p>

<p>She was startled when she opened the drawing-room
door and confronted Mr. Addis and Bonnie
May.</p>

<p>“Enter the heroine!” was the child’s greeting.
“Exit the crowd.” She would have left the room,
then, but Miss Baron stood in her way.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“Enter the heroine!” was the child’s greeting.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Bonnie May!” she cried with gentle severity,
“I’m afraid you’re going to get us all into trouble
one of these days.” She turned with a flush to Mr.
Addis. “Good evening,” she said, with reproach
in her tone. She added, with gentle mischief: “You
seem to have gained an ally.”</p>

<p>Mr. Addis was on his feet, shaking her hand
vigorously. “I have,” he confessed. “But please
don’t blame her. I think I haven’t set her a very
good example.”</p>

<p>Flora turned to the child with a kind of forlorn
fondness and made a characteristic movement, as
if she were pushing escaping strands of hair into
place. She appeared not to observe that Mr. Addis
was still holding her hand. Then with evident decision
she moved away from him.</p>

<p>“It won’t do,” she declared, meeting the visitor’s
eyes. “It’s not the right way to do things.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to think of the right way,”
replied Mr. Addis with dignity.</p>

<p>“But doing things secretly ... I don’t believe
anything is worth having unless you can have it
honestly—even a friendship. You know how
mother feels. And—and I can’t quarrel with her.
I think a little injustice is better than quarrelling.”
Her voice held a note of sadness, of discouragement.</p>

<p>Mr. Addis suddenly stood more erect. “Miss
Flora, you’re right,” he said. “I mustn’t try to
hide anything. I won’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“Bonnie May,” said Flora, “will you please go
and ask mother to come down?”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” agreed Mr. Addis. “The thing for
me to do is to have a little talk with her.” And
then they waited, without looking at each other,
until Mrs. Baron descended the stairs and entered
the room.</p>

<p>The poor old lady’s manner hardened the instant
she appeared.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Addis,” she said in a tone
of frank resentment. “I don’t believe we were
expecting you.”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t expected,” replied Mr. Addis. “I
hope you’ll excuse me for taking you by surprise.”</p>

<p>Flora was holding to a chair as if for support.
She did not sit down.</p>

<p>“There’s no harm done,” said Mrs. Baron. “I
dare say there won’t be.” She seated herself with
great firmness of purpose and looked from Mr.
Addis to Flora, and then back to Mr. Addis without
winking.</p>

<p>This aloof form of bullying had a happy effect
upon Mr. Addis. He became ominously calm.</p>

<p>“No, no harm at all,” he said. “On the contrary.
I think a little plain talk may be the best
thing for all of us. Maybe I haven’t come to the
point as I should have done, up to now. I think
I’ve been a little timid, you know. But here’s the
fact. I think Miss Flora here is the finest girl I’ve
ever met. I’ve got great respect for you, too, Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Baron. And for your family. But—the plain
truth is, I want Miss Flora. I don’t say she’s mine
for the asking. But I want the right and the chance
to consult her about it. If she tells me she’s quite
sure I won’t do, that’ll settle it. But you seem to
have made up your mind beforehand that Flora
shall not have a mind of her own. One of the
reasons why I think so highly of her is that she is
a good daughter. That isn’t such a common thing
nowadays, Mrs. Baron. She’s nice and high-minded.
She wouldn’t stoop to any tricks. She’s
a young lady who tells the truth. And that, if you
will excuse me, is something I like to do myself.
What I want to point out is that I don’t believe
you’ve thought what it means for you to take advantage
of her obedience and respect. You don’t
want her to pay a penalty for being a good girl.
Give her a chance. Give me a chance. I don’t
mind your proving to her that I wouldn’t make
her a good husband—if you can. But you can
trust to her sense and to her honor. Be frank with
her. Don’t treat her as if she were a child. You
know, ma’am, it’s her affair more than it is yours,
after all. Give her and me a chance to talk it
over.”</p>

<p>Flora’s color came and went during this patient,
rather labored recital. The utterly prosaic course
events were taking, as a result of her mother’s
prejudice, impressed her strangely. She could have
laughed—but also she could have wept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>Mrs. Baron had refused to meet Mr. Addis’s
eyes while he spoke, but now she compelled herself
to regard him. Her eyebrows were at a most formidable
elevation. “I have tried to impress you with
the fact, Mr. Addis,” she said, “that I do not consider
you a suitable person to—to become associated
in any way with my family.”</p>

<p>Mr. Addis flushed. “The loss would be mine,
ma’am, if I were not permitted to be friendly toward
all the members of your family, but, if you will
pardon me, I can very easily console myself for
the loss, if I have Miss Flora.” These words Mr.
Addis spoke with unmistakable emphasis.</p>

<p>“Would you mind,” said Mrs. Baron, speaking
very evenly, “would you mind not speaking quite
so loudly?”</p>

<p>She succeeded in conveying the idea that he had
violated all the laws of good taste, and that she
had borne with him like a martyr.</p>

<p>Mr. Addis looked at her questioningly. When
he spoke again his voice was low, his words were
measured.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said. “I always tell
my young men not to become too spirited when
they’re in earnest. If I have offended in that way
I ask you to excuse me.”</p>

<p>There was a lump in Flora’s throat. He had
accepted a rebuke which seemed to her needless,
and even cruel, with just the kind of dignity which
her mother should have prized above all other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
qualities. And he seemed so splendidly simple and
earnest and strong.</p>

<p>She came forward with an obvious effort to speak
and move easily. “Mother,” she said, “Mr. Addis
is only asking to be received here as a visitor. He
has paid us the compliment of wishing to become
better acquainted with us. Can you think of any
good reason why he shouldn’t?—because, really, I
can’t think of any at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t!” responded her mother. “Then
I’ll make it plain to you. For the present I must
ask you to go up-stairs and let me have a word
with this—this gentleman, who appears to have
his own method of getting into houses where he
isn’t invited.”</p>

<p>Flora was too deeply wounded to respond to
this. Shame and grief were in her glance. “Good
night,” she said. She went out of the room without
glancing back. But there was something strangely
eloquent in her exit. She seemed to take with her
beauty and light, and to leave the room a prey to
all manner of unloveliness.</p>

<p>Something in her bearing had dismayed Mrs.
Baron. Something, too, in the cold, steady glance
of Mr. Addis dismayed her. She turned nervously
toward the hall. “Flora!” she called. “Flora!”
And she followed her daughter up the broad stairway.</p>

<p>They had all forgotten Bonnie May. When she
had summoned Mrs. Baron, at the behest of Flora<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
and Mr. Addis, she had returned, quietly and unobserved,
and had taken her place inconspicuously
in a far corner of the room.</p>

<p>Now she came forward, a light of eagerness in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“That was a great speech you made,” she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Addis, gazing toward the empty staircase,
seemed unaware of her presence.</p>

<p>“It was good stuff,” she added, and then Mr.
Addis turned to her with an almost unseeing glance.</p>

<p>“I think it’s time for you to go off-stage,” she
added nervously. “But I’ll bet you one thing.
When the big climax comes, you and Flora will be
standing in the middle of the stage, close together,
and the rest will be grouped about just to fill out
the picture.”</p>

<p>She let him out at the door. She did not seem
to be at all disturbed because he seemed scarcely
conscious of her presence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>A QUESTION OF RECONSTRUCTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> keeping with the Baron manner, no mention of
Mr. Addis’s name was made openly in the mansion
the next morning. The normal atmosphere was
changed only by a more pronounced reticence,
which doubtless hid varying degrees of sullenness
or resentment. But there was no lack of politeness.
On the contrary, there was an excess of it.</p>

<p>Of course it was realized that Mr. Addis had not
been finally disposed of. Mrs. Baron’s idea was to
await developments—and so was Flora’s.</p>

<p>Only Bonnie May violated the well-established
tradition of the household.</p>

<p>Early in the morning she encountered Flora, and
made occasion to engage her in a brief conversation.
Flora was planning to go out with the McKelvey
girls after breakfast, and she held in her
hands the green-and-silver tailored skirt when
Bonnie May came upon her. She was regarding
it with the care and heartache of a young woman
in love with pretty things who has very few of
them, and she did not seem quite responsive when
the child began a somewhat extraordinary commentary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>She scarcely heeded Bonnie May’s introductory
words, but she <i>did</i> begin to pay attention when
she heard this:</p>

<p>“Of course I know I’ve got nothing to do with
the giving out of parts, but if I had, he’d strike me
just right for the rôle of the husband.”</p>

<p>Miss Baron flushed. She knew just whom the
child meant, but she felt that she must pretend
to some measure of doubt.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you talking about?”
she asked. Her faint smile robbed her words of
sharpness.</p>

<p>“I think he’s just the kind that would look well
to the people in the gallery, and to the people down
in the parquet, too. Mr. Addis.”</p>

<p>Flora sat down in an aimless fashion, holding the
green-and-silver skirt across her knees.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” she asked meditatively, “that
he would look well—anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean, do I think he would look—ridic’lous,
anywhere?”</p>

<p>Miss Baron leaned back and looked with a sort
of mournful joyousness at the ceiling. “You do
say such amazing things!” she declared. “To use
your word, You don’t think he would look ridiculous
anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Never in the world!” was the emphatic response.</p>

<p>“But you know he isn’t at all like—well, like the
leading men in plays, for example.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“You mean what they call matinée idols?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s entirely different from them, isn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t want him to be like them,
would you?”</p>

<p>Miss Baron shook her head slowly. “No, <i>I</i>
wouldn’t....”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how he strikes me,” said Bonnie
May. “If he came on the stage, the audience would
think it was the business manager, come to make an
announcement. You know the business manager is
the man who has the money—sometimes; who pays
the hotel bills and finds out about train-time, and
sees that your baggage is there ahead of you when
you get to the end of a trip. He’s the real man
with the show. These fellas that look like fashion-plates
are all right as far as they go. But you
know once in a while the walking gets bad, and
then the wise guys are the ones that stand in with
the business manager.”</p>

<p>She went away, nodding with emphasis, and
left Miss Baron to complete her toilet.</p>

<p>Beyond this brief interchange of words not a
word about Mr. Addis had been spoken when
Baron, immediately after breakfast, went away in
response to a telephone call from a newspaper
office. The Sunday editor had an idea for a special
article and, as it turned out, Baron was employed
down-town all day.</p>

<p>There was a “story” about an exhibit in one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the art-galleries to write, and this he had done with
one of those intervals of ardor which characterized
him.</p>

<p>He had also called on Thornburg. He wanted
to know how the mysterious quest of Bonnie May
was progressing, and if the manager had learned
anything as a result of his response to the advertisement
in the <i>Times.</i></p>

<p>But Thornburg had no information for him.
He had replied to the advertisement according to
his promise, he said, but he had received no response.
He admitted quite frankly that he had
permitted two days to pass before doing this. He
had been unusually busy. But he had attended to
the matter as soon as he had been able to find
time—and nothing had come of it.</p>

<p>However, as Baron was leaving the manager’s
office, Thornburg called him back. “By the way,”
he said, “it is possible Mrs. Thornburg may have
something interesting to tell you. I just happened
to remember that she asked me to invite you up
to the house when I saw you. I believe she mentioned
Bonnie May. Suppose you drop around as
soon as it’s convenient.”</p>

<p>On his way home that afternoon, Baron thought
of the manager’s message and his manner, and
again he became suspicious. He couldn’t help believing
that Thornburg knew more than he admitted.
But then, he concluded, perhaps he was
only innocently plotting to get possession of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
child for whom there now appeared to be no lawful
claimant.</p>

<p>When he reached home his mother was the first
person he encountered, and he surmised by her
manner that this circumstance was a result of her
own design and management.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong, mother?” he asked. He had
visions of kidnappers watching the house from
hidden points of vantage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron led the way into the dining-room and
took a seat in the bay window overlooking the
anæmic grass-plot.</p>

<p>“Yes—entirely wrong,” she responded. “Do you
know what this country had after the Civil War?”</p>

<p>“Of course. It had peace.”</p>

<p>“It had reconstruction.”</p>

<p>“Oh!—reconstruction. Certainly.”</p>

<p>“<i>That’s</i> what I’m going to have in this household.”</p>

<p>“All in favor of reconstruction will signify—”
began Baron lightly. But his mother interrupted
him quite sharply.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to be annoyed any more by
that man Addis,” she declared, a flush mounting
to her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Baron, for the first time comprehending.
“And my part in the—the new order of things
is to begin snubbing him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you look at it in that way. I
don’t intend he shall come here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>Baron looked at her thoughtfully. “My difficulty
is,” he said, “that I understand your position,
and his, too. And Flora’s. Addis is an awfully
decent chap. I think you don’t look at him
quite right. He’s got lots of friends of the right
sort. Men friends. He doesn’t go in for the—oh,
the ladylike things. But he belongs to the hunting
clubs, and some of the best commercial clubs,
and—well, I’m sure he’s every inch a man.”</p>

<p>“So far as we’re concerned, he’s every inch a
grocer.”</p>

<p>Baron winced. “Oh, mother!” he protested,
and after an interval of silence, “mother!” he exclaimed,
“what are we? What am I? A loafer,
living off a woman’s money; depending on my
parents; having no prospects of my own making.
There are times when I wish I had learned how
to be a grocer, or a blacksmith, or a carpenter, or
anything that would give me a place I could put
a label on. Honestly, I don’t see that <i>I’ve</i> got
anything to make me look down on—on anybody.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron was not at all impressed by this.
“I won’t answer that sort of nonsense,” she said.
“And as for Mr. Addis——”</p>

<p>The door into the kitchen opened and Mrs.
Shepard stood revealed. Her brow was furrowed.
She looked beseechingly at Mrs. Baron.</p>

<p>“Yes, right away,” said Mrs. Baron, rising. But
she paused and looked at her son again. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
that—that unruly child who’s been letting him in.
She’s to be taken in hand, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother?”</p>

<p>“As long as she’s here you and Flora have got to
quit treating her as if she were a—a fairy queen.
It’s absurd. She’s got to be restrained and—and
enlightened.”</p>

<p>“I’m quite willing to do my part. The trouble
is I’ve been too busy being enlightened by her to
do very much enlightening on my part.”</p>

<p>“Well, she hasn’t enlightened me at all. And
I’ll be able to attend to her without a great deal of
aid. She’s got to get down out of the clouds, to
real things.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t seem to fit in with our kind of
realities, does she?” he conceded. And then he
smiled. “If it were only right to regard even children
simply as human beings! They have to be
themselves sooner or later. If it were only possible
to let them develop along that line from the
start!”</p>

<p>But the kitchen door had been opened by Mrs.
Shepard again—this time timorously and incompletely—and
Mrs. Baron was gone.</p>

<p>Baron climbed two flights of stairs before he
came upon the object of his next search. Bonnie
May was in the attic.</p>

<p>She was all eagerness when she saw him. “Do
you know what happened to-day?” she began.</p>

<p>Baron stopped abruptly. “Happened!” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
echoed, unworded speculations again flooding his
mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing wrong. It’s just—Mrs. Baron
gave me my first music lesson.”</p>

<p>“Music lesson!” he echoed, and then: “Was
<i>that</i> all?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it enough?” She came close to him and
whispered: “I’m to be ‘cultivated.’”</p>

<p>He frowned. “I don’t like the word. Who said
so?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind about a word. Honestly, it
wasn’t so bad. I’ve often thought I’d like to be
able to hit a few high spots on the piano. Sometimes
a little thing like that means ever so much
to you. Imagine yourself having the lead in a play
with a lot of love-making in it. You have a line
like this—to the leading man: ‘You’ll be like all
the rest. You’ll forget me among all those gay
scenes.’ Don’t you see how much it helps if you
can say it sitting on a piano-stool, and winding up
by turning to the keyboard and trifling with it
softly? You don’t need to play well. It wouldn’t
do to play really well. Just a little, you know.
Absent-mindedly, with your head down. That’s
what I want to be able to do.”</p>

<p>Baron had pulled a chair close to the window.
“And so you took a music lesson?” he asked. He
was recalling the serenely inefficient manner in
which his mother played certain familiar hymns.
It did not occur to him that she would attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
teach Bonnie May anything but this class of music.
Indeed, he felt sure she would not have been able
to recall any other kind. “I’m glad you don’t object
to it,” he said. Presently he added, without
very much interest in the subject: “After all, some
of the old hymns are very pretty.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but you know I’m not going to play
hymns.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re not! What does mother expect to
teach you, then?”</p>

<p>“At first she thought hymns would do; but
when I explained to her that I wouldn’t care to
play them she said we could take up something
else.”</p>

<p>Baron regarded her steadily. She was obviously
withholding something. “Bonnie May!” he remonstrated.
“You didn’t have another disagreement,
did you?”</p>

<p>“It was more like an argument—and I must
say she behaved beautifully.”</p>

<p>“And did you behave ‘beautifully,’ too?”</p>

<p>She had drawn her chair close to the window and
was looking out, so that he saw, chiefly, a small
shoulder and a profile which was quite eloquent of
independence and courage. “Yes, I think I did.
Of course, it was harder for me than for her. You
see, I had to be It, as the saying is. Yes, that’s
how to express it. She had framed the game up,
and I had to be It.”</p>

<p>“What—what really happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“She began in that innocent way of hers. She
thought a little knowledge of music would be good
for me. I said yes to that. Yes, she went on, it
would be quite proper for me to learn to play some
of the simpler hymns. When she said ‘hymns’——”</p>

<p>She sat quite askew and laughed, and when
Baron made no response at all she became uneasy.
“You know you’ve got to protect yourself,” she
insisted defiantly.</p>

<p>“Very well; and then what?”</p>

<p>“I told her it was so good of her to be willing
to teach me, but that—well, I told her hymns
wouldn’t do.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t they do? They’re music.”</p>

<p>“It’s like I told her. Hymns are all well enough
for persons who don’t understand very well—like
raised letters for the blind. But when Mrs. Shepard
lets me set the table, how would it sound if I kept
saying: ‘I’m helping Mrs. Shepard! I’m helping
Mrs. Shepard!’ She might be too polite to say
anything, but she’d be thinking: ‘The gabby little
thing, why don’t she just do it and let it go at that?’
On the other hand, if I just did the best I could
without making out that I was the whole show,
she’d be apt to say: ‘Bless her heart, she’s really
helping.’ I think singing hymns is about the same
thing. It’s as if you kept saying: ‘I’m praising God!
I’m praising God!’ It would be—oh, bad taste.
But if you sang ‘Annie Laurie,’ or something like
that, you can imagine they’d bend their ears up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
in the skies—if they can hear that far—and say:
‘Isn’t that nice?’ That’s what I said to Mrs.
Baron. Some spiel, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Baron was glad that she turned to him for only
the briefest scrutiny.</p>

<p>“And—what did mother say?” he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“I thought she was going to have the curtain
let down for a minute. She looked so funny. But
you see, she knew I was right. Anybody could
see that. She stared at me. And I stared at her,
too—only mine was different. Mine was what you
call a baby stare. Innocent, you know.” She
turned to him again, and something in his eyes
checked her. “Oh, I know how that sounded to
you,” she said with quick remonstrance. “You
never put things like that into words. But you
know very well everybody <i>does</i> have special ways
of looking when they want to. As if they didn’t
understand, or as if they were surprised—or weren’t.
You have to do things like that. That’s all I
meant.”</p>

<p>“I—think I understand,” said Baron.</p>

<p>They remained silent for a time, and through
Baron’s mind a single phrase kept running: “Like
raised letters for the blind.” Wasn’t cynicism,
wherever it existed, merely a protest by people of
refined taste against the inartistic forms which goodness
often assumed? And hadn’t he and his family
always paid far too little heed to the golden legends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
of life, and too much to the desire to have them in
“raised letters”?</p>

<p>He was aroused by the voice of his companion;
by her voice and by the eagerness with which she
gazed at a little drama which was being enacted
down in the street. An enormous, red-faced beer-driver
had stopped his dray at the curb to chat
with a ruddy-cheeked, buxom girl with glossy black
hair, who was laughing up into his face. The two
powerful brewery horses stood patiently at rest,
their eyes harboring the placid expression of the
weary draft-horse that comes immediately when
a stop is made.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they happy?” commented Bonnie May,
speaking as if from the indulgent summit of great
age.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Baron argued. “I shouldn’t
think it very probable.”</p>

<p>“But can’t you see that they are?”</p>

<p>“Because they are laughing?”</p>

<p>“That—and their eyes. The way they are looking
at each other is just as if they were patting
each other on the cheeks—now, isn’t it? I think
they are both just beautiful. They look as if they
were quite happy, and didn’t care to be anything
else.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Who ever heard of a beer-driver
being beautiful? And such an enormous creature,
and the kind of work he does, and—and such
clothes!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_fp180">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fp180.jpg" alt="They look as if they were quite happy">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“They look as if they were quite happy—and didn’t care
to be anything else.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Her brows contracted. “Aren’t you prejudiced
against him just because—well, maybe, because of
the kind of work he does?”</p>

<p>“I think maybe I am. I should think anybody
might be.”</p>

<p>“I see. You was thinking something ugly about
him—so, of course, he wouldn’t look nice to you.
You see, I wasn’t. I think maybe he does that
kind of work because he was never taught to do
anything else. If your work isn’t lovely, I think
you deserve all the more credit, if you can be glad
while you’re doing it.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see—people choose their work—they
choose to be what they are.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I didn’t. Did you?”</p>

<p>“And just see how—how <i>loud</i> he is! And notice
the color of his face and hands!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. She continued to look critically,
and her eyes were filled with joy when the
driver suddenly leaned back and laughed until the
sound reached them above the scores of other
noises. “That’s because he laughs so much, and
is out in the sun and the weather most of the time.
I think he’s lovely—yes, I do. For my part, I’d
like to get up on the seat and ride with him. I’ll
bet he would take good care of you. And you can
see that nice girl would, too.”</p>

<p>“With a beer-driver!” exclaimed Baron, really
amazed.</p>

<p>She regarded him serenely. “Oh, a beer-driver,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
she said. “I wouldn’t think about that part of it
at all. I would have to know something about him
that really counted, if it came down to an argument.
You’re only thinking of his make-up. And,
my goodness! I’ve seen many a Simon Legree go
into his dressing-room and change his clothes—and
come out the nicest sort of a fellow. I’ve got a
hunch that if there is—” She paused, shamefaced,
and then continued: “If there is somebody up in
the skies keeping tab—somebody managing the
big stage—the whole world, I mean—he knows just
what we are, or ought to be, if the make-up wasn’t
there to make us seem ugly and mean and hateful.”</p>

<p>“But, look here! That isn’t a make-up that
fellow down there has on; it’s himself!”</p>

<p>“Not at all! What’s the difference whether it is
the wardrobe mistress that hands you what you
have to wear, or—or just accident? I mean the
way you happen to get started, and whatever it is
you have to do. You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean, well enough. But what
<i>I</i> mean is, why should you suppose that chap
down there didn’t get just what he studied for—what
he fitted himself for?”</p>

<p>“Because they give you a part and say: ‘This
is your part,’ and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, on the stage—possibly. But what can you
see in that fellow that makes you think there’s
anything to him—that he’d be trustworthy, for
example?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>She leaned forward, wholly alert. “It’s easy,”
she declared. “See how he sits, with his feet square
on the dashboard, and with his head held up high
that way. That means he knows what he’s about.”</p>

<p>Baron felt himself getting red in the face. He
remembered his habit of sitting with his legs tangled
up when he was at his ease. Quite cautiously he
got himself into a more purposeful attitude. “Anything
else?” he asked.</p>

<p>The beer-driver was now driving away.</p>

<p>“Yes. Look at the way he is holding those
reins—nice and straight and firm. The horses
know he’s there, all right. They trust him. They
<i>know</i> him. Look at him now! It’s just as if he
were saying to them: ‘Take it easy, old fellows,
we’re all here together.’”</p>

<p>Baron leaned forward and watched the disappearing
dray. Yes, there was a certain method in
the man’s way of holding the reins, and in his
whole bearing, which suggested just what the child
had put into words.</p>

<p>He leaned back and clasped his hands behind
his head and smiled.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bonnie May anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I couldn’t explain to you. I was
just thinking about—about certain forms of reconstruction.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>MRS. THORNBURG REVEALS A SECRET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron</span> shook his head slowly. He had been thinking
about that advertisement in the <i>Times</i> which
Thornburg had answered without any result.</p>

<p>“Strange,” he mused. “I won’t believe but that
somebody is looking for her—somewhere. Children
like that are not dropped down and deserted
like superfluous kittens or puppies. There’s something
wrong somewhere.”</p>

<p>Then he remembered that Mrs. Thornburg wished
to see him; that, according to Thornburg, she had
“mentioned Bonnie May.”</p>

<p>Possibly she knew something. At any rate,
Baron felt that he ought to call on her. It was
just after the dinner-hour—of the day on which
Mrs. Baron had announced her policy of reconstruction—and
the evening was flinging a challenge
to all mankind to get out of doors and enjoy
the spring air.</p>

<p>He took up his stick and hat and left the house.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He found Mrs. Thornburg sadly changed since
he had seen her last. She was unmistakably very
ill, though the only symptoms revealed to Baron’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
inexpert eye were a pathetic thinness and pallor
and a profound lassitude.</p>

<p>She was alone, Thornburg having just gone out.</p>

<p>“It was good of you to come,” she said when
Baron entered. She spoke as if she had been expecting
him. And without circumlocution she continued:
“I wanted to talk to you about the little
girl. You haven’t let anybody have her, have
you?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Baron. Then he added lightly:
“I think we’ve changed our minds about letting
her go. It seems likely now that we’ll keep her
with us indefinitely.”</p>

<p>He was glad that her glance rested upon her
thin, clasped hands. He could note the effect of
his statement with a steady scrutiny which need
cause him no compunction.</p>

<p>To his surprise she seemed quite pleased. “It
makes me glad to know that she is to be with nice
people,” she said, lifting to him now a softly grateful
glance. She explained: “You see, I’m sure
I’m too ill to have her now, even if....” Her
lips trembled and her eyes filled.</p>

<p>“But you’ll be better,” said Baron, reading her
thought. Clearly she had despaired of ever being
any better. “When you’re able to have her, she’ll
be so happy to visit you. I mean Bonnie May.
She’s a wonderfully sociable little creature. If
she were invited to come to see you she would be
delighted. Attentions like that—such as you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
pay to grown people—have a wonderful effect
upon her.”</p>

<p>“Yes.... And of course some day she will be
coming here to stay.”</p>

<p>“You mean—” Baron was surprised that his
suggestion had been received with a dully uttered,
enigmatic remark, rather than gratitude or eagerness.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what I mean by that?” There
was regret in her tone, reluctance in her glance—as
if she knew he was not dealing honestly and
frankly by her.</p>

<p>“No, truly, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well.... But I wanted to tell you why
I was so eager to have her when you called before.
You see, I wanted to—to atone....”</p>

<p>She sat listlessly, lost in troubled memories, and
Baron waited.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thornburg came to me one time, in the one
moment of his greatest need, and asked me to help
him. And I failed him.”</p>

<p>She leaned back and closed her eyes for a moment,
and Baron thought how out of harmony she
was: the ailing woman whose whole being was in
a minor key, amid surroundings which suggested
only sturdiness and well-being.</p>

<p>“He was always generous toward me, and patient.
He was always giving, giving, and never
asking. I think I got used to that and just took
it for granted. And then one day he came home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
excited, as happy as a child ... and asked me....
It was such a little thing ... and I refused.</p>

<p>“You know, he had been married when I first
met him. An actress. It didn’t last long. She
got tired of the life and wanted to go back to the
stage. I think she appealed to his generosity. It
would have been easy to do that. At any rate,
he allowed her to go away and take their little girl.
I can’t understand how he brought himself to let
the little daughter go, too. I have an idea he was
so troubled because <i>she</i> wanted to go that he didn’t
realize how much the child meant to him, or would
come to mean. She was only a year old then. I
never blamed him for that episode in his life. I
just concluded that the woman was worthless. And
when I married him we didn’t speak of his other
marriage—nothing in connection with it. It was
just as if it hadn’t happened. Then, after a year,
or about a year, he—he made the one request of
me. The mother had offered to give him the little
girl. He wanted to bring her to me, to have her in
our home.</p>

<p>“And that made me jealous and unhappy. I
can’t explain ... or defend myself. I could
scarcely answer him when he spoke about it. And
when I didn’t answer he looked at me, and after
a little a strange expression came into his eyes.
He was chilled and bewildered. He had been so
happy. He couldn’t understand. He just gave
it up, and the next day he was trying to pretend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
that nothing had come between us; that I hadn’t
been ungracious and cruel.</p>

<p>“You see, I was thinking of <i>her</i> child, and he was
thinking of his own. Mine was the woman’s—the
narrow—point of view, and his was the father’s.
Maybe you can understand a little of what I felt. I
couldn’t have the child here in the house, while
its own mother.... It would have been like
giving <i>her</i> a place in our home—the woman, I
mean. You can’t really separate people by putting
their bodies in different places. You see what I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Baron, “I think I see quite
clearly.”</p>

<p>“And I was sure she was a bad woman. And I
felt that if her child were in the house, her—her
real self would be here, too. Her influence, I mean.
Bodies are not everything. Sometimes they’re
even the least things of all. I was afraid that other
woman’s very presence would be here among us
on the most sacred occasions: at bedtime, to see
if her child were covered up, and in the early hours
of Christmas morning, jealously looking to see what
we’d given her, and jealous of us, because we were
fond of her. She would be a real influence in the
house. It couldn’t be helped.”</p>

<p>“But a bad woman.... Surely a bad woman
would forget,” suggested Baron.</p>

<p>“Well, not our kind of a woman, anyway. How
could she have deserted a man who was good to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
her? And how could she consent to give up her
child afterward? It might be right for her to
leave her husband; but for a mother to give up a
little daughter.... No, I couldn’t think of having
here in our home a link to bind us with a woman
like that—a life out in the unknown, on the streets
that are strange to us, that are strange to all faithful,
happy people.</p>

<p>“And then when it was too late I began to see
his side of it. He was the father just as much as
she was the mother. She was <i>his</i> child as much as
hers—more, if he loved her more. And I began to
realize what it must be to a father to have his little
daughter away from him, perhaps not loved and
provided for, possibly facing an evil future. Oh,
the night that thought came to me! And always
he was so kind to me, and patient. He did not
speak of his daughter again. And I waited....
I knew he would speak again some day, and I
wanted to grow strong enough to say to him
honestly: ‘Ah, do bring her, and she shall have
love here, here in her own home’....”</p>

<p>She lifted her hands to her cheeks and closed her
eyes. It was as if she must shut out some of the
impressions which crowded into her mind.</p>

<p>Baron waited until a measure of calm came upon
her. “And—he never did?”</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and regarded him inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I mean, he never spoke of her again?”</p>

<p>She regarded him with a smouldering look in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
eyes. Then she leaned forward, her hands gripping
the arms of her chair. “I honestly believe you
don’t know!” she whispered.</p>

<p>And in an instant she had taken from a little
box on the table near which she sat an envelope.
She drew from it a single sheet and passed it to
Baron.</p>

<p>He turned a little, so that the light from the
table fell upon it and read:</p>

<p>“<i>Do be good to the little girl your husband has brought
to you. You ought to be, because he is her father.</i>”</p>

<p>There was no name. Baron handed the sheet
back to her. He was thinking hard. “Who could
have written it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course you realize that I don’t <i>know</i>,” she
replied. “Do you mean to ask me what I think?”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think?”</p>

<p>“I think her mother wrote it. I think she must
have lost track of the child, and concluded that
Mr. Thornburg had taken her. I think she must
have known of my—my jealousy on that other
occasion. I think she wrote this note hoping that
I would refuse to have the child in the house if I
knew who she was. It seems plain that she wants
her now.”</p>

<p>Baron was examining the date of the postmark
on the envelope. She saw that furrows were gathering
on his forehead.</p>

<p>She explained: “It came some time ago. I had
it with me here when you called that first time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Oh!” exclaimed Baron. “And you knew,
then——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew then.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t.... Mr. Thornburg....”</p>

<p>“I didn’t show him this. He doesn’t know.
Surely you can understand. He has acted a lie,
in trying to get the little girl into the house without
telling me about her. And I can’t blame him
for that, after what happened that other time.
But I can’t bear to let him know that—that I
know.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see, if Bonnie May is really his
daughter, and if he weren’t afraid to tell you so,
he could bring her here without any further hinderance!”</p>

<p>“No, he couldn’t. Not if the mother wants
her.”</p>

<p>Baron arose. “After all, it’s largely guesswork—conclusions
reached in the dark,” he said. “You’ve
received an anonymous note. That’s all the foundation
you have for what you’ve told me. And people
who write anonymous letters....”</p>

<p>He reflected dubiously, and then he came to a
decision.</p>

<p>“I’ve reason to believe,” he said, “that there is
good ground for you to reject what’s in that note.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward, observing him intently.</p>

<p>Baron was remembering the actress who had
called on Thornburg; the woman who, almost certainly,
was she who had taken the child into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
Thornburg’s theatre. He was recalling his question
to the manager, and the latter’s vehement, prompt
response.</p>

<p>“You mean,” questioned Mrs. Thornburg, “that
you don’t think Bonnie May is really ... that
you don’t believe it was her mother who wrote
this note?”</p>

<p>“It’s difficult to be quite sure of anything,”
said Baron, “but I would stake a great deal on
that one thing being true—that it wasn’t Bonnie
May’s mother who wrote that anonymous note.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>“A KIND OF DUEL”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night in his attic room Baron arrived, by
perfectly logical reasoning, at two conclusions,
each of which was precisely the opposite of the
other.</p>

<p>The first of these conclusions was that he had a
perfect right to shape Bonnie May’s future according
to his own inclination. The second was
that he had no right at all to do such a thing.</p>

<p>He arrived at the first conclusion in this manner:</p>

<p>He had made an honest effort to locate any
person or persons having a legal and just claim on
the child, and he had failed. If the Thornburgs
had any claim upon her, it was not his fault that
they had bungled their affairs until they were unwilling
to make their claim public.</p>

<p>Therefore he had a right to have and to hold
Bonnie May, and to regard her, if not as his own,
at least as a permanent member of the household.</p>

<p>His second and contrary opinion began to shape
itself when he recalled the picture of Mrs. Thornburg,
helpless and despairing, greatly desiring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
presence of the child in her own home in order that
she might complete a great moral victory over
herself.</p>

<p>A man couldn’t oppose his claims and advantages
to a need like that!</p>

<p>Besides—it was borne in upon Baron more and
more strongly—there was a very serious question
as to the child’s best interests.</p>

<p>She was an actress, born and bred, and some
day she would surely hear the call of the theatre.
Not in the near future certainly. Baron couldn’t
bear to associate children and the stage. But in
a few years....</p>

<p>And if she were ever to return to the profession
which was her birthright, it was Thornburg she
would need, and not the Barons.</p>

<p>Moreover, Thornburg was a wealthy man, and
childless. He was now ready to take the child
into his home as his own. There could be only
one outcome to such an arrangement—an outcome
wholly in Bonnie May’s favor.</p>

<p>Therefore, his—Baron’s—right to keep the child
was of the shakiest possible nature.</p>

<p>And having reached these two conclusions, dwelling
now upon the one and now upon the other,
Baron extinguished his light and went to bed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the morning at about seven o’clock, while
he was standing before the glass with a military
hair-brush in his hand, his problem was solved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
for him in a flash. He stood with the brush suspended
in air. A light leaped into his eyes.</p>

<p>“How simple!” he exclaimed. “The very way
out of it. The only way.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At three o’clock that afternoon he entered Thornburg’s
private office, after having taken the precaution
of ascertaining (1st) that Thornburg had
returned from luncheon in a fairly good humor,
and (2d) that the manager was alone.</p>

<p>“You know I had a little talk with Mrs. Thornburg
about Bonnie May last night,” he began,
when Thornburg had thrust a chair toward him.
He was assuming his most casual manner, primarily
because it suited his present purpose, and also
because he had not failed to note that Thornburg’s
face had darkened slightly at sight of him.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.” The manager glanced at his
desk as if he were a very busy man.</p>

<p>“I felt the least bit—up a tree, as the fellow said,
after I had talked to her,” continued Baron. “You
know I want to—to be decent about things.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed the manager, giving part of
his attention to the papers which were strewn about
his desk. “And I suppose the child is a good deal
of a burden——”</p>

<p>He glanced up, and Baron wondered why a man
shouldn’t be able to keep the light of triumph out
of his eyes when he really tried to.</p>

<p>“Not at all!” he interrupted blandly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“——or that you are sure she will be, when the
novelty of having her about wears off.” He squared
about sharply, with the air of a man who means
to do something handsome. “I’m still ready to
take her, if you decide that you’d like to give her
up. Of course, I don’t know how soon I might
change my mind. In case Mrs. Thornburg loses
interest, I’d be through with the case, naturally.”</p>

<p>He turned to his desk again and examined a
letter which came uppermost, frowning and pursing
his lips as if he were giving it deep consideration.</p>

<p>Baron did not wholly succeed in repressing a
smile. “All wrong,” he said amiably. “The Greeks
must have borne gifts to you before now, Thornburg.
No, I’m not tired of her. I’m not likely to be,
either. Why, she’s like a tonic. Sense? You
wouldn’t believe it. She’s forever surprising you
by taking some familiar old idea and making you
really see it for the first time. She can stay at
our house until the roof falls in, if she only will—though
of course I don’t hope she’d be willing to.
But don’t think there’s any question of our getting
tired of her. She’s not that kind. I might add,
neither are we.”</p>

<p>Much to his amazement Thornburg sprang to
his feet excitedly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re getting at!” he exclaimed.
“If you’ve got anything to say, why not
say it and be done with it?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_fp196">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fp196.jpg" alt="I don’t know what you’re getting at!">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“I don’t know what you’re getting at!” he exclaimed. “If
you’ve got anything to say, why not say it and be done
with it?”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>Baron arose, too. He thought he was justified
in feeling offended. “I think,” he said quietly,
“I haven’t got anything to say, after all.” He
managed to keep his voice and eyes under control.
These proclaimed no unfriendliness. But his lips
had become somewhat rigid.</p>

<p>“But you did have,” retorted Thornburg. He
sat down again and produced a handkerchief with
which he wiped his face and neck nervously.
“Come, don’t pay any attention to my bad manners.
You know I’ve got a thousand things to
worry me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. I’m really trying to help—or I
had the thought of helping. You—you make it a
bit difficult.”</p>

<p>“There was something about the little girl,”
said Thornburg.</p>

<p>“Yes. As to her—status. Chapter I—the inquiry
for her, and our little flurry—seems to be
completed.”</p>

<p>“They probably didn’t care about her very
much.”</p>

<p>“Well—possibly. At any rate, we seem to have
come to a full stop for the time being. And I’ve
been thinking about the future. I ought to tell
you that after my talk with Mrs. Thornburg, the
case didn’t seem quite so simple as it had seemed.”</p>

<p>Thornburg, clasping his knee in his hands, was
bending upon the floor a gaze darkened by labored
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“I’ve begun to feel a kind of moral responsibility.
At first I thought only of my own point of view.
My family’s, I mean. Our interests and pleasures.
But you see there’s also something to be said from
the standpoint of our—our guest. I wouldn’t
want to lessen her chances of future happiness. I
wouldn’t want to have my way altogether and
then find out after a while that it had been the
wrong way. I never realized before how much
the people of the stage are born and not made.
That’s the gist of the matter. There will come a
time when nothing in the world is going to keep
Bonnie May off the stage. That’s my conviction
now.”</p>

<p>“They say children <i>do</i> inherit—” interposed
Thornburg.</p>

<p>“The question of her future stumps you a bit.
It’s not as if she were like any other little girl I ever
heard of. It’s like this: I’d like to have a skylark
in a cage, if it would sing for me. But I’d never
be able to forget that its right place was in the
sky. You see what I mean. I don’t want to be
wholly responsible for keeping Bonnie May—out
of the sky.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“My ideas aren’t exactly definite. But I want
her to be free. I want her to have a part in working
things out the way she wants them.”</p>

<p>“That’s good sense. Turn her over to me, then.”</p>

<p>“That’s not the idea at all. I think up to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
certain point it may be good for her to experience
the—the gentle tyrannies which are part of her
life with us. On the other hand, if she becomes
identified with you (I don’t know just what other
word to use), and you get to be fond of her, why
then in a material sense.... Oh, I don’t like
the tone of that at all. But you’ll get the idea,
and take it for granted that what I’m trying to get
at is that I don’t want to stand in Bonnie May’s
light.”</p>

<p>Baron tried to join the manager in the latter’s
impatient laugh. “You’ll have to excuse my denseness,”
said Thornburg. “I get your meaning as
easy as I can see into a pocket. The way it sounds
to me is that you’re sure you want to keep her,
and that you’re just as sure that you don’t want
to keep her.”</p>

<p>“That’s nearly it,” admitted Baron, flushing
slightly. “Suppose I say that I want to keep her
a part of the time, and that I’d like you to keep
her the other part. Suppose I offer to share her
with you: to encourage her to visit Mrs. Thornburg
a day at a time—days at a time—a week at
a time. Suppose we take her on a kind of partnership
basis. No unfair influence; no special inducements.
Suppose I make it plain to her that you
and Mrs. Thornburg are her real friends, and that
you will be glad to have her come as often as she
likes, and stay as long as she likes.”</p>

<p>Thornburg’s eyes were beginning to brighten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Would you,” added Baron, “do the same thing
by us? I mean, would you encourage her to come
to us when she felt like it, and see that she had the
chance to go as freely as she came?”</p>

<p>Thornburg’s flushed face was all good-nature
now. The little barriers which he had kept between
his visitor and himself fell away completely.</p>

<p>“A kind of duel between us,” he elaborated, “to
see which of us has the best attractions to offer?”</p>

<p>“Well—yes, you might put it that way, I suppose.
That’s a theatrical phrase, I believe. Perhaps
it wouldn’t have occurred to me. At any
rate, the plan I’ve outlined would give her a chance
to do a little deciding on her own account. It
would give her a chance to give her affections to
those who win them. It would place some of the
responsibility for her future on her own shoulders.
And whatever conclusions she came to I’d be willing
to bank on.”</p>

<p>“That,” declared Thornburg with enthusiasm,
“is what I call the proposition of a first-class sport.”
He extended his hand to Baron. “You stick to
your part of the bargain and I’ll play fair to the
letter.”</p>

<p>He would have shown Baron out of the office,
then. He had a taste for suitable climaxes, too.
But Baron lingered, chiefly because he didn’t like
the prospect of an almost mischievous conflict
which the manager seemed to welcome and to
anticipate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“She can be loyal to us all,” he said, “if she’s
encouraged in being.”</p>

<p>At the sound of his own words he fell to thinking.</p>

<p>No, she wouldn’t need to be encouraged. She
would be loyal without that. There was nothing to
fear on that score at all.</p>

<p>He looked up rather whimsically. “Well, I’ll
tell her,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’ll tell her——”</p>

<p>“That she has been invited to visit Mr. and Mrs.
Thornburg, and make herself quite at home.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>MRS. BARON TAKES UP THE GAUNTLET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> decided upon what he conceived to be an
admirable plan of action, Baron was unwilling to
believe that he ought to be in any hurry to execute
his plan.</p>

<p>For the time being Bonnie May was getting
along very well indeed. In fact, Baron made a
point of looking into this matter with a good deal
of thoroughness, from a somewhat new angle, and
he was greatly pleased by what he discovered.</p>

<p>Little by little the child had become habituated
to the home atmosphere. This, of course, was
due largely to the fact that the other members of
the family had become habituated to having her
about. They no longer felt constrained to utter
pleasant nothings, or to hold their tongues, because
of her presence. When they forgot her
“strangeness,” she ceased to be strange.</p>

<p>She obediently and even intelligently attended
when Mrs. Baron gave her her lesson on the piano.</p>

<p>“Though I think,” she confided to Baron on one
occasion, “I could get hold of the high places without
going through all the funny business she seems
to regard so highly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>Baron spoke in defense of the “funny business,”
and presently she agreed with him.</p>

<p>The guest’s wardrobe had been made gloriously
complete, and in this relationship another pleasant
development was to be noted.</p>

<p>Bonnie May had been painfully accustomed to
the use of trunks. Now she made the acquaintance
of bureau drawers, and her delight was unbounded.
She spent hours in arranging her things. She won
Flora’s genuine applause by her skill and taste in
this matter.</p>

<p>Flora bought her a hat.</p>

<p>She looked at it in a queerly detached manner
for an instant. “Oh, a hat,” she commented. She
might have been repeating a word spoken by a
travel-lecturer, describing some interesting place
which did not seem to concern her. It appeared
that she never had owned a hat.</p>

<p>She put it on before the glass. “Oh!” she cried.
She thrust impulsive arms about Flora’s neck and
hugged her.</p>

<p>Flora enjoyed that experience so much that she
bought another hat which she described as “unmade.”
Ribbons of gay colors, and white lace, and
little silk flowers of various hues, came with it, and
the child was given these materials to experiment
with as she pleased. Flora gave advice, and was
ready with assistance.</p>

<p>Again the result was interesting. Bonnie May
experienced a joy which was rapt, almost tremulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
in quality. A desert-bred bird, coming upon an
oasis, might have regarded its surroundings with
the same incredulous rapture.</p>

<p>Baron’s room became hers permanently, and
here she developed a keen delight in “housekeeping.”
Here also she received Mrs. Baron and
Flora as guests, and amazed them by her performance
of the part of hostess.</p>

<p>“I call it nonsense,” declared Mrs. Baron to
Flora, after the two had paid a formal call. But
her face was flushed with happiness and her voice
was unwontedly soft.</p>

<p>“Not nonsense,” responded Flora; “it’s just
happiness.”</p>

<p>She spent whole afternoons with Mrs. Shepard
in the kitchen and dining-room. She learned how
to bake little cakes.</p>

<p>It became her duty—by her own request—to
set the table, and upon this task she expended the
most earnest thought.</p>

<p>Baron commented upon this on one occasion.
“Ah, you’re not an artist, after all. You’re a
Gretchen,” he said.</p>

<p>“But everything about the table is so pretty
and nice,” she responded. “It’s as elegant as a
table in a play, and ever so much more sensible.
You know something always happens when you
sit down to a table on the stage. A servant comes
in and says: ‘Beg pardon, mum, but there’s a gentleman—he
says he’s your uncle from Green Bay’—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> 
then everybody gets up in a hurry, because
the uncle is supposed to believe his niece has a lot
of children he’s been helping to support, when she
hasn’t got any at all. Or something like that.”</p>

<p>In brief, there were a hundred accumulating
evidences to prove that Bonnie May in the Baron
household was the right individual in the right
place.</p>

<p>It is true that Mrs. Baron did not forget how
Thornburg had called on a certain night to take
the child away, and how she had given him to
understand—she supposed—that she would expect
him back on the same errand some other time.
And Baron could not free his mind of the fact that
he had voluntarily entered into a compact by
which his guest must sooner or later be lost to the
household at least a part of the time.</p>

<p>But these were matters which were not discussed
in the family.</p>

<p>A week passed—two weeks, and Baron hadn’t
seen Thornburg or communicated with him. One
day in June the thermometer shot up in real midsummer
fashion, and the audiences in most of the
theatres were such that all the shrewd managers
became listless and absent-minded. The “regular
season” was over.</p>

<p>Thornburg closed his theatre and turned his
attention to a summer resort where there was an
opportunity to launch an <i>al fresco</i> entertainment
scheme. “Everybody was leaving town.” There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
remained only the uncounted thousands for whom
some lighter form of entertainment must be provided.</p>

<p>The flight of time, the inevitable march of events,
brought to Baron a realization of the fact that
there was a promise he must keep. And so one day,
during an hour in the attic, he spoke to Bonnie
May.</p>

<p>She didn’t seem to pay any attention at all to
his preliminary words. It slowly dawned upon her
that what Baron was saying concerned her in a
special way.</p>

<p>“... people you will be interested in, I am
sure,” Baron was saying. “Thornburg, the name
is.” He glanced at her; but the name had made
no impression. “Mrs. Thornburg is not very
strong, and a cheerful visit ought to be just the
thing to help her. Mr. Thornburg is a theatrical
man. Why, it was his theatre I met you in. They
have a beautiful home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that makes me think,” was all the reply
he received. “What became of the man who had
a play?”</p>

<p>“Eh—a play?”</p>

<p>“You remember—when I first came. He had
the first act and read it to you in the library, and
I had to go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Oh—Baggot. He’s probably forgotten all about
it by this time. Or writing another that he’ll never
finish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>She shook her head, unconvinced. “He was so
enthusiastic,” she objected.</p>

<p>So for the time being there was an end to the discussion
of her visit to the Thornburgs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Another week passed, and then Baron had an
extraordinarily busy day.</p>

<p>In the forenoon came a letter from one of the
dramatic editors for whom Baron had done special
work occasionally.</p>

<p>“They are launching some sort of a dramatic
stock enterprise out at Fairyland to-night,” the
letter ran, “and I’m hoping you can do it for me.
Thornburg is managing it. I don’t hope it will
be much as a dramatic proposition, but you might
be able to get some readable impressions. Please
let me know.”</p>

<p>A later mail brought a communication from
Thornburg.</p>

<p>The sight of the manager’s signature brought
Baron up with a jerk—but he was reassured by the
first few lines. Thornburg wasn’t charging him
with bad faith. Instead, he was enclosing an order
for an unlimited number of seats for the Fairyland
opening.</p>

<p>“I understand,” ran a pencilled line by way of
postscript and explanation, “that you are to represent
the <i>Times</i> to-night.”</p>

<p>Also there was a letter from Baggot. Baggot’s
play had reached a stage where it needed Baron’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
inspection. The budding playwright asked no
questions. He merely declared his intention of
calling that night.</p>

<p>Baron went up into the attic to look at the morning
paper. He wanted to know what they were
doing out at Fairyland, and who was doing it.</p>

<p>And while he noted one impressive name after
another, he was arrested by an altogether amazing
sound down in his mother’s sitting-room. Mrs.
Baron had been giving Bonnie May her music
lesson, and now, the lesson done, she was singing
for her pupil.</p>

<p>The thin old voice faltered on some of the notes,
but the words came clear enough:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“... She’s all the world to me,</div>
<div class="verse">And for bonnie Annie Laurie....”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Baron smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“What was it,” he mused, “about a plan of
reconstruction?”</p>

<p>Then he went down-stairs to telephone his acceptance
to the man on the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>Baggot he completely forgot.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Baron entered the dining-room at dinner-time
that evening Flora looked at him with mild
surprise.</p>

<p>“All dressed up and nowhere to go,” said she.</p>

<p>“But there is somewhere to go. I’m going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
write up the Fairyland opening. Would you like
to go with me?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p>It was clearly understood that Baron’s question
had been put in a spirit of jest. It was understood
that Flora and her kind did not go to the Fairylands—and
their kind.</p>

<p>But Bonnie May failed to grasp the situation.</p>

<p>“What’s Fairyland?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“A large enclosure occupied entirely by mad
people, and with a theatre in one corner.”</p>

<p>She ignored the reference to mad people. “Oh!
a theatre. What are they playing?”</p>

<p>“A piece called ‘The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,’”
said Baron.</p>

<p>She sat up, swiftly erect, and clasped her hands.
“How fine!” was her comment. “Do you think
you could take me?”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” Baron responded without
thinking. His unthinking refusal was a result of
the habitual Baron attitude. But as he regarded
her thoughtfully, and noted the puzzled inquiry
in her glance, he couldn’t quite understand why
he had been so emphatic, so confident of being
right. “It’s not a play a little girl would care for,”
he added, now on the defensive.</p>

<p>She smiled indulgently. “The idea! I mean,
<i>anybody</i> would be interested in it.”</p>

<p>“What’s it about?” challenged Baron.</p>

<p>“A lady who died because they were unkind to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
her—even the people who loved her. It’s about a
lot of snobs and a—a human being.” She spoke
with feeling. She sensed the fact that again she
was being required to stand alone.</p>

<p>Baron frowned. “How in the world did you find
out anything about a play like that?”</p>

<p>“Miss Barry did it in Denver one time—when
she was with a stock company. I can’t understand
why you speak as if there was something wrong
about it. I think it’s great. You can cry like anything
when you see it—because it seems as if what
happens couldn’t have been helped. It isn’t one
of those things that’s been screwed around to make
everybody feel as if they’d been eating caramels.
You remember it!”</p>

<p>Baron, Sr., engaged in carving the roast, twinkled
somewhat darkly.</p>

<p>“You might get her to shape your criticism for
you, Victor,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if the editor would stand for
‘screwed around,’” said Baron, “but upon my
soul, I think she’s right.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you think you could take me, then?”
asked Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“It really isn’t possible. You see, I must hurry
down to the office right after the performance—to
write it, you know.”</p>

<p>The child leaned toward Mrs. Baron, a very
real shadow trembling on her face. “Couldn’t you
go, so you could bring me home?” she asked. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
voice was nearly inaudible, through fear of disappointment.
“I haven’t been for such a long time.
You can’t think how dearly I’d like to go.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron was provoked by the child’s intense
earnestness. “Oh—impossible!” she said. She
noted the look of despair in Bonnie May’s eyes.
“There wouldn’t be enough tickets, anyway,” she
added weakly.</p>

<p>Baron leaned back in his chair as if he had lost
his appetite. What was the matter with them all,
anyway, that they were afraid to get down into the
crowd once in a while? Plenty of really nice people
went to all manner of places—in search of novelty,
for diversion, in order to get into touch with mankind.
He had spoken of mad persons out at Fairyland.
That was merely a silly cynicism. They
weren’t any madder than other people. Surely
they were saner, since they were willing to enjoy
the best that life afforded.</p>

<p>“I’ve got plenty of seats, mother,” he said. He
returned to his dinner, smiling somewhat maliciously.</p>

<p>“Victor!” exclaimed Mrs. Baron. She flushed
angrily. “You know very well I won’t go to such
a place.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May’s voice trailed away to a whisper—almost
to a whimper. “Nice people can go anywhere
they want to go,” she said. “It’s only silly
people who need to be afraid, because they don’t
know how to think for themselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>She tried very hard to eat her dinner then, and
to say no more. But presently she said, faintly,
“Please excuse me,” and ran, weeping in true
childish abandon, from the room.</p>

<p>It was the first time she had really lost control
over herself!</p>

<p>Baron, Sr., was the first to speak. “She’s only a
child,” he said, as if anything more would be superfluous.</p>

<p>An ensuing silence was broken by the sound of
the telephone-bell, and Mrs. Baron was glad to
respond, as a means of putting the finishing touches
to an uncomfortable episode.</p>

<p>But the telephone seemed only to create other
difficulties. The group at the table were quite at
a loss to know what could have brought such an
extraordinary sharpness into Mrs. Baron’s voice.
She was soon grasping the receiver angrily, and
they heard her saying, with uncomfortable intervals
between her words and phrases: “To-night?
Bonnie May? Mr. Baron? Why should he do
anything of the kind? No, I don’t understand at
all. No....” She turned around in quick displeasure.
“Victor,” she appealed, “will you see
what they want?”</p>

<p>And Baron hurried to the phone and took up the
broken conversation.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Thornburg!” he began. Then, after
a pause, “Yes, that was the understanding. There
wasn’t any definite time set—” A pause. “Yes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
I know he is. I’m going out there, too.” Another
pause, and then, “Well, I suppose it might be
managed. I’ll ask <i>her</i>. I promised—we both
agreed—that she should do as she pleased——”</p>

<p>He turned back to the table with a brave attempt
at briskness. But the inquiring glances bent upon
him were disconcerting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron went and unceremoniously hung up
the receiver. She had, it seemed, understood quite
accurately what the person at the other end of
the phone had been saying.</p>

<p>“It’s an invitation for Bonnie May,” said Baron,
trying to shake off the feeling that he was a guilty
wretch. “Mrs. Thornburg particularly wishes her
to come over this evening, because she’s to be alone.”</p>

<p>“Well!” was Mrs. Baron’s comment. “Why
should she go over there, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>Baron hesitated. “The fact is, I entered into a
sort of compact with Thornburg——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I gathered something of the kind,” said
Mrs. Baron angrily. “I suppose I have nothing
to say, one way or another.”</p>

<p>“It was when you were still of the belief that
Bonnie May couldn’t be—quite comfortable with
us, and Thornburg.... I don’t think I was
wholly unjustified in what I promised. You remember
you said that as soon as she could be got
ready—” He was floundering painfully now, with
the eyes of everybody in the room turned upon
him accusingly. “Mrs. Thornburg says she has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
a room ready, specially fitted up for her, and she
only asks that she may spend the night——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron had a vision of that room that had
been “specially fitted up” for the child, who was
now away somewhere grieving because she had
been refused a greatly coveted privilege. No doubt
the Thornburg woman had spent whole weeks and
no end of money in fitting up that room. And she
thought with a sinking heart of the gloom of the
mansion, and its threadbare aspects.</p>

<p>“Victor Baron,” she cried angrily, “I wish you
would tell me just what agreement you made with
that theatre man. I want to know where I stand.”</p>

<p>And Baron explained—or, rather, he failed to
explain very clearly. The idea of “a sort of duel”
not only failed to delight his auditors as it had delighted
Thornburg, but they looked as if they considered
it a type of criminal and unseemly folly.</p>

<p>“You see,” persisted Baron, “the Thornburgs
are rich people. They may go so far as to adopt
Bonnie May, if the thing works out satisfactorily.
I know how that sounds, but we’ve got to think
of—of <i>her</i> interests, as well as our own whims.”</p>

<p>“Whims!” This, witheringly, from Mrs. Baron.</p>

<p>“I think it was mostly whims at first, anyway.”</p>

<p>“You’re speaking for yourself—not for me.”</p>

<p>“And the Thornburgs are not bad people. I
don’t see why they shouldn’t make her quite happy.
I’m not at all sure we could do as much, if we undertook
to keep her here constantly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“That,” said Mrs. Baron “is your mean way of
reminding me of what happened just a little while
ago!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, mother! But she’s such a joyous little
thing! I think she’ll like us all the better for seeing
other people once in a while.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron gazed at her son silently, her face
darkening. He realized that her mind was filled
with scorn, with resistance, with misgivings. “And
I suppose,” she said, “that everything in their
house is the newest and brightest and costliest!”
She enumerated these qualities as if she were pointing
out so many of the cardinal sins.</p>

<p>Baron pretended not to understand. “They
live nicely,” he said. “But as far as Bonnie May is
concerned, I don’t think you need fear that the
things the Thornburgs have will give them any
advantage over us.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want her to go,” declared Mrs.
Baron.</p>

<p>Baron was standing in indecision when, happily,
there was an interruption.</p>

<p>The front door closed rather noisily, as it did
when Mrs. Shepard was not in a very good humor,
and there was the sound of Baggot’s voice in the
hall.</p>

<p>Baron groaned. He had forgotten about Baggot.
He went out into the hall and confronted the
playwright apologetically. “I’d really forgotten,”
he began, but Baggot cut him short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“It’s all right,” remarked that young man.
“Come on up to the library. I needn’t keep you
long. But it’s simply necessary—” He was leading
the way up-stairs as if he were in his own house.</p>

<p>“Look here, Baggot,” remonstrated Baron, “I’ve
got to go out to-night, in half an hour—in fifteen
minutes. You’ll have to come back some other
night.”</p>

<p>“Where you going?”</p>

<p>Baron gasped at the man’s rudeness.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to review a play, out at——”</p>

<p>“Fine! I’ll go with you!”</p>

<p>Baron sank into a chair. There really wasn’t
any reason why Baggot shouldn’t go with him.
“But I’m going on the street-car,” he explained.
“We couldn’t read a play——”</p>

<p>“It’s not ready to be read, most of it. I’ve only
got a couple of acts and the scenario. But there
are certain things....” He pulled his chair
closer to Baron’s and began an eager discussion
of his play.</p>

<p>Time passed, and Flora appeared in the doorway.
Her eyes were inscrutable. “Mother wishes
to see you before you go out,” she said.</p>

<p>“Will she come up here?” pleaded Baron. He
wanted to hide behind Baggot and escape a further
scolding.</p>

<p>“I’ll ask her,” replied Flora.</p>

<p>Baggot, leaning forward and speaking with great intensity,
continued on the subject which obsessed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Time flew, and Baron found himself nervously
jerking out his watch. Then there was a faint rustle
of dresses out in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>She was dressed with all the exquisite, subtle
attention to detail which never failed to make
Baron proud of her. He took in the quiet, old-fashioned
jewelry, sparingly displayed; the softened
dignity of costume; the fine severity of her beautiful
hair. Surely she was every inch a gentlewoman
of whom any son might be proud.</p>

<p>She held Bonnie May, smiling serenely, by the
hand.</p>

<p>“I just wanted you to know,” she said, standing
impressively erect and speaking with quiet resolution,
“that we are ready to go to the play.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>BONNIE MAY LOOKS BACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Baggot’s</span> play, it seemed, was really a charming
thing—a modernized fairy-story.</p>

<p>To the monotonous rumble of revolving car-wheels
the plot was outlined, the characters
sketched. Baron felt the dramatic force of it,
the surprises. But as the enthusiastic playwright
proceeded with his self-appointed task, Baron began
to realize, also, that he and his companions
and their affairs constituted a very queer sort of
drama.</p>

<p>By his side sat Baggot, and in front of them
were his mother and Bonnie May. Mrs. Baron,
for special reasons of her own, was making a studied
and persistent effort to be entertaining. She talked
to the child almost continuously. But Baron could
not help seeing that Bonnie May was determinedly
playing a double rôle. She was politely pretending
to listen to every word Mrs. Baron said, but she
was also keeping one ear eagerly turned toward
Baggot.</p>

<p>Baggot, for his part, saw only that Baron seemed
to be giving a good deal of his attention to the
little girl in the seat ahead. He couldn’t make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
any excuse for such division of interest. He began
leaning forward at frequent intervals to catch
Baron’s eye—to see if the points he was making
were going home.</p>

<p>Only Mrs. Baron remained in a single-minded
mood. She continued to talk amiably, and no
doubt a bit wearyingly. She was determined that
Bonnie May should have no ground for complaint
that she was not being properly entertained.</p>

<p>“You see,” Baggot was saying, “the central
figure is an elf, or a sprite, who is supposed to be
an embodiment of the good traits in human nature.
And then there are witches, and gnomes, and
dwarfs, and some big fellows—vikings and Titans
and giants—and some figures put in for the sake
of—well, variety: druids, and people like that.
And Psyche—to make a swell picture. Looking
at her reflection, you know. All but the central
figure, the sprite, are supposed to embody faulty
traits, like cruelty, or vanity, or superstition, or
jealousy, or envy, or fear. And then certain other
qualities—for comedy effects, like laziness, or stubbornness,
or stupidity. See? And the sprite governs
them all, little by little, until in the end they
turn into fairies, or nice human beings. A great
transformation scene....”</p>

<p>Baggot stopped suddenly and frowned. “It
sounds childish, telling it. As if it were some silly
sort of extravaganza. But there’s the dialogue.
Smart and unexpected, you know. Modern drawing-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
stuff put up against the heart of the
forest and the figures of the story-books. Bringing
the sublime and the ridiculous together, you
know—and the material and the ideal, and the
every-day and the remote. Silly fallacies of our
own day, set against the truth in words such as
Æsop would have used.” He stopped suddenly
and threw out his hands in a despairing gesture.
“Oh, what’s the use?” he demanded. “I can’t
get at it at all, just talking about it. You’ll have
to see it in writing.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I understand,” Baron reassured him.
“You don’t put it so vaguely at all. And you
know I saw the first act.”</p>

<p>“Yes.... But I’ve done that over—ever so
much better.” He clasped his knee in his hands
and fidgeted for a moment. And then he broke
out with—“And the settings! The four seasons,
in the forest, for the four acts. Big things to hit
the eye—but nicely, you know, so that the drama
doesn’t suffer—so that it’s not choked, you might
say.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Baron, “I understand.”</p>

<p>Baggot began to go more into detail touching
the plot. He put this part of it very incisively.
Occasionally he laughed, or his eyes blazed with
satisfaction. He had reached the end before it
was time for them to leave the car.</p>

<p>Bonnie May had seemed to be listening attentively
to Mrs. Baron; but once Baron heard her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
say, with slight confusion: “I beg your pardon,”
because she had not responded to a question that
had been put to her.</p>

<p>Now, as they were getting ready to leave the
car, she nodded her head decisively.</p>

<p>“Why are you nodding?” asked Mrs. Baron.
She was frankly irritated.</p>

<p>And the child prevaricated. “Oh, I think it’s
because I’m—well, satisfied.”</p>

<p>The entrance to Fairyland might have been
described as a study in chaos. Hundreds of people
were pouring into the gates, and they were all
coming immediately under the spell of the bedlam
of noises and the blaze of lights.</p>

<p>Baron had one moment of grave doubt as he
marshalled his party before getting into the vortex
of human forms. He thought his mother could
not have looked less satisfied with things in general
if she had been the Peri of the legend, just turned
back from paradise because she hadn’t brought
the thing that was expected of her.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Baron was playing a game. Rather,
she was fighting a battle, and she remarked calmly,
in response to Baron’s anxious look. “It won’t
be so bad after we get inside.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you’re right,” replied Baron; and
then they all pressed forward.</p>

<p>They got by the gatemen just as a car of the
scenic-railway variety was cut loose from its moorings
on a high platform to which it had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
dragged, and began its incredibly swift descent
along a far-off vista of trees and lights. Women
shrieked as if they were being enveloped in flames,
and tried to hold their hats in place.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” was Mrs. Baron’s comment; whereupon
Baron dropped back a step, and hid his mouth
with his hand.</p>

<p>The inrush of persons behind kept them going
somewhat smartly past the first group of “attractions”:
an “old mill-wheel,” with an entirely
uniform supply of water tumbling down upon its
buckets; a shooting-gallery; a negro with terrified,
grinning face protruding from a hole in a curtain
as a target for a group of men who were throwing
baseballs.</p>

<p>A merry-go-round started just as Baron’s party
passed, and a popular melody was ground out with
quite superfluous vehemence. Mrs. Baron paused—startled
into making a halt, seemingly—just
long enough to catch a glimpse of an elderly couple,
a man and a woman, mounted upon two highly
colored lions. They were undoubtedly country people,
and the woman’s expression indicated that she
was determined not to betray unfamiliarity with
the high life of the city.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron hadn’t even an ejaculation which
seemed at all adequate to her needs in this case.</p>

<p>“I think the theatre’s over this way,” said Baron,
steering a course which promised escape from the
main currents of the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Yes, there was the theatre, standing on a knoll
with trees growing on its sides. A curved, flower-bordered
road led up to its entrance.</p>

<p>Conditions rapidly improved. There weren’t
nearly so many people, and what there were were
of a quieter type.</p>

<p>Half-way up the knoll Baron turned about for
a bird’s-eye view of the whole place. But beneath
them a Midway blazed, and he caught sight
of a lady on a platform before a tent, who was
coiling a very large snake about her neck, while
a little farther away a princess—she seemed to be—in
red satin and spangles, sat wearily on a palanquin
on top of a camel.</p>

<p>He thought it would be as well for his mother
not to see these choicest fascinations of Fairyland.
He directed attention to the theatre ahead, which
was modelled after what is left of a famous Roman
ruin. And so they completed their climb without
looking back.</p>

<p>A grove surrounded the theatre, and under the
trees there were chairs and tables.</p>

<p>“Chairs!” exclaimed Mrs. Baron. “They’re
the first thing I’ve seen....” She turned one
about and sat down.</p>

<p>“Fine idea, that,” said Baron. “Let’s all sit down.”</p>

<p>“It’s plenty of time to go in when you hear the
overture begin,” observed Bonnie May; whereat
Mrs. Baron regarded her with rather a blank expression;
but she said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>From the portals of the theatre strolled Thornburg,
and instantly his glance took in Baron and
his party.</p>

<p>It was Baggot who observed that the manager
seemed about to join them.</p>

<p>The manager did. He came toward them across
the grass and shook hands with Baron. He was
smiling almost benignantly.</p>

<p>Baron introduced his party. Thornburg was
rather casually cordial in his manner. Then he
took in the fact that the child in the party was
Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“So this is the little girl?” he inquired. He
drew her to his side and flushed with pleasure.
His entire appearance changed. “I had an idea
she might be over to the house to-night,” he added,
turning to Baron.</p>

<p>“No,” said Baron, “she preferred to come with
us.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May shrank slightly from the stranger’s
touch; but after she had regarded him critically
she yielded to it. He seemed rather a good sort,
she thought. He wasn’t loud, and he didn’t take
things for granted too much.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Baron stiffened and seemed bent upon
bringing upon the entire group that discomfort
and embarrassment the creation of which is one
of the finer social accomplishments. “Sit down,
Bonnie May,” she said. She patted an unoccupied
chair with her hand and smiled. There was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
in her manner which caused Bonnie May
to regard her with surprise.</p>

<p>Thornburg, too, observed her rather deliberately.
For an instant he seemed to forget himself, to be
absent-minded. Thornburg was of that type of
man who seems to surrender unconditionally when
a woman employs strategies, but who resolves to
do what he pleases when her back is turned.</p>

<p>Baron resented his mother’s attitude, her decision
not to be communicative and gracious. He
stood by the manager’s side and spoke of the splendid
picture the garden presented. For a moment
they stood in silence, looking down upon the tangle
of many-colored lights which marked the course
of the Midway.</p>

<p>The steady stream of people who had been entering
the theatre had begun to diminish, and now
the notes of the overture arose—the “Poet and
Peasant.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May sprang to her feet. “There it is,”
she said, and both Baron and Thornburg smiled
down on her. Then Thornburg escorted the party
into the theatre.</p>

<p>Baron noted the immense audience, sitting in
a blaze of light; a fairly quiet and pleasant-appearing
audience. He noted, too, that where one might
have expected to find walls at right and left there
were vast open spaces, through which stars, beyond
waving horizontal branches, were visible.
Rolled canvas, which might be let down in case of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
rain, rattled slightly in the breeze, and one or two
disturbed sparrows darted into the place and rested,
chirping, on a girder overhead.</p>

<p>Then Baron had eyes only for Bonnie May, who
had undergone some strange sort of transformation
the moment she had entered the theatre.</p>

<p>Her eyes were enough to thrill an ordinary world-weary
person. Her color became brilliant. Then
her body began to respond to some overmastering
influence. One might have thought of her as a
little palfrey about to enter a great parade with
many bands in it. She was not merely proud and
happy; she was quite entranced with delight.</p>

<p>When the usher, with the manner of his kind,
darted down the aisle until he was some eight
or ten steps in advance of the party, the child
hurried forward a little, and then turned about, her
face alight with eagerness; and suddenly she stood
still until Mrs. Baron came up to her, and seized
that amazed lady’s hand and laid her cheek against
it and patted it rapidly.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, child,” whispered Mrs. Baron
warningly, in dread of a scene; but her voice was
like a caress, and her eyes were beaming with joy.
She was thinking how little she had had to sacrifice,
and how very well worth while the sacrifice had
been. Truly, it would have been cruel to deprive
the child of a pleasure which meant so much to
her.</p>

<p>The man who stood with his big bass fiddle in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
the orchestra pit was making a dreadful noise on
one string—sawing it rapidly—when the usher
flung down a row of seats. Mrs. Baron went in
first, followed by Bonnie May. Baron took the
next seat, leaving the aisle seat to Baggot.</p>

<p>The overture ended, and the orchestra leader
laid down his baton, while he and his musicians
began to adjust themselves in easy positions in
their chairs.</p>

<p>Somewhere a man at a switchboard performed his
duty, and one light after another went out until the
theatre was in darkness.</p>

<p>Then the curtain lifted.</p>

<p>But to Baron it all meant less the story of Paula
Tanqueray, up there on the stage, than it did the
story of Bonnie May, close by his side. Tanqueray’s
friends discussed his approaching marriage and his
bride to be; the argument of the drama received
its simple statement, and presently the ill-starred
woman appeared. But through it all Baron knew
that his thoughts were chiefly with the child by
his side.</p>

<p>She was so completely lost in the rapture of every
passing moment that he felt a strange uneasiness.
Here was something more than a normal enjoyment.
She had the extraordinary gift of being able
to appraise the value of the make-believe—to gauge
the truth of every look and word and movement,
and at the same time to lose herself in the story.
She clasped and unclasped her hands in silent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
painful intensity; there were little, strange movements
of her head as a result of her acute sympathy
with the work of the playwright and players
alike. And sometimes she hung upon a word that
halted, and smiled with rapture when a difficulty
was surmounted.</p>

<p>Baron thought, grotesquely enough, of a little
fish fallen from a hook into the grass for a breathless
moment, and then getting back into its proper
element and rushing away with a mighty flicking
of tail and fins.</p>

<p>Bonnie May had been of the theatre once, and
Baron realized, as he watched her, that somehow,
sometime, she would return to it again.</p>

<p>When, at the end, the report of a pistol was
heard, and the stepdaughter of Mrs. Tanqueray came
screaming upon the stage, Mrs. Baron set her lips
in a hard line.</p>

<p>“Nobody to blame but herself!” was her comment.
She, too, had been deeply impressed by the
play.</p>

<p>But the larger faith of the little girl asserted itself.
“Oh, don’t say that!” she begged. “She’d
have been all right, if they’d really loved her in
spite of all!”</p>

<p>It was the reality of it that held her, Baron perceived—or
her ability to see it as something real.</p>

<p>The puppets, the make-believe—these were off
the stage, for Bonnie May. The truth and beauty
and reality were on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>He smiled thoughtfully as they all filed up the
aisle, amid a babble of voices. The child might be
wrong; but was it strange that so glorious an ignis
fatuus should have power to lead her on to the
end?</p>

<p>As they left the theatre they passed Thornburg,
standing near the entrance alone. For an instant
there was a peculiar, inscrutable expression in his
eyes; then he pulled himself together and smiled
and lifted his hat. But after this perfunctory
greeting was over, the manager steadily regarded
Mrs. Baron, who did not look at him.</p>

<p>That quiet, masked glance made Baron uncomfortable,
and instinctively he stooped and took
Bonnie May firmly by the hand.</p>

<p>In another moment they were lost in the throng.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>CONCERNING LAUGHTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next afternoon Baron received a very cordial
letter from Thornburg. The manager was delighted
with the fine account of the Fairyland opening
that had been printed in the <i>Times</i>. That was
the sum and substance of his letter. There was
nothing about the compact to which Baron was a
party.</p>

<p>“Just the same, he’s got something up his sleeve,”
Baron mused. And his next thought was: “But
I’ve kept my word. If she doesn’t want to go
there’s no reason why I should urge her to. She’s
getting along all right where she is.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two weeks slipped by, and then one day at noon
as Baron was emerging from the lobby of the <i>Times</i>
building he heard a familiar voice in the street.
The Thornburg automobile stopped and the manager
pushed the door open.</p>

<p>“Been to lunch yet?” called Thornburg.</p>

<p>“Just going,” was the response. Baron would
have prevaricated if he’d had time to think; but
now it was too late and he made the best of the
matter as Thornburg pulled him into the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“Come with me,” said the manager, and then he
became silent as he threaded the machine through
the down-town congestion.</p>

<p>He did not speak again until they were in a comparatively
quiet restaurant whose patronage was
drawn chiefly from theatrical people who did not
come in until late in the evening.</p>

<p>Both men observed that they were to have the
place practically to themselves, and then Baron
was promptly given to understand what it was that
Thornburg wanted.</p>

<p>“That’s really a fine little girl,” said the manager,
frankly regarding Baron across the table.</p>

<p>“You mean Bonnie May. Yes, she certainly is.
The fact is, you can’t begin to realize how uncommonly
fine she is until you know her better.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just the point. When <i>am</i> I going
to know her better? When is she coming to us?”</p>

<p>Baron gave his whole attention to the waiter for
a minute. He was trying to think of a response
that wouldn’t concede too much. He held the strong
cards now. It would be foolish to relinquish them.</p>

<p>The waiter was gone now.</p>

<p>“The fact is, Thornburg,” said Baron, “she
doesn’t seem at all eager to accept your invitation.
I’ve told her about it, and explained what a fine
place you’ve got, and all that—and she just changes
the subject. You know I didn’t agree to force her
to act. That’s just what we both agreed not to
do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Childish timidity—the first time,” said Thornburg.
“If you’d bring her over once she’d get over
feeling that way.”</p>

<p>“She’s just about as timid as a sunbeam. She’d
go anywhere if she thought she’d enjoy it. The
fact is, she’s absolutely satisfied where she is, at
present. Let the matter rest awhile. When things
become monotonous I’ll call her attention again
to your invitation.”</p>

<p>Thornburg shook out his napkin violently. “That
sounds like beating about the bush,” he said. “You
know how to get a child started. ‘Oh, look!’ you
say to them. Get them excited. Then they’ll do
anything.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to get her excited,” replied Baron
dryly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s just it!” retorted the other. “A
little excitement would be good for her. I see the
advantage of having her at your place part of the
time, but I see the advantage of having her with
us, too. It would be a shame if she ever got to
thinking highly of some of this polite flubdub—”
He checked himself in embarrassment and brushed
imaginary crumbs from his waistcoat.</p>

<p>“Won’t you enlighten me as to what you mean
by ‘polite flubdub’?”</p>

<p>Thornburg became almost defiant. “Being chilly,
for one thing. And not seeing people. That kind
of business. It used to be all right, but it’s out of
date now. Class distinctions and that sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
thing—that’s all done away with. You might as
well hang a knitted tidy up in an art display.
Nothing but the goods counts these days.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you’re right,” responded Baron
briefly. He felt it would be impossible for him to
admit that he saw any special application in what
Thornburg had said.</p>

<p>A silence followed. Baron permitted a considerable
degree of arrogance to stifle his friendlier
thoughts. Thornburg had spoken offensively;
which was rather less excusable than “polite flubdub.”</p>

<p>Yet, Baron reflected, nothing in Thornburg’s
manner could alter the fact that it might be greatly
to Bonnie May’s advantage to accept the hospitality
of the manager and his wife.</p>

<p>The impression of the child in the theatre not
long ago recurred to him—the imperative call upon
her which the skill of the players had exerted.</p>

<p>“You’re right, Thornburg,” he said finally.
“I’ve been procrastinating—that’s all. I’ll speak
to her again. The next time I’ll even say ‘Oh,
look!’—or words to that effect. In your own expressive
phrase, we’ll give her a chance to decide
which of us ‘has the better attraction to offer.’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This new promise weighed heavily on his conscience
that afternoon when he went home; for
Bonnie May, unusually radiant, was waiting for
him at the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>“Mr. Baggot was here to-day,” she began. “He
left his play. And he talked to me about it. He
said you might keep it as long as you liked.”</p>

<p>“All very kind of Mr. Baggot.” Baron thoughtfully
disposed of his hat and cane. When he turned
to the child again there was a little furrow between
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Bonnie May,” he began, “do you remember my
telling you some time ago that Mr. and Mrs. Thornburg
would be glad to have you visit them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember.”</p>

<p>“They thought possibly you might have forgotten.
They asked me to remind you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. And he’s made the prettiest copy
of it, with red lines drawn under the words you
don’t have to learn. Can’t we go up-stairs and
see it? I put it in your room.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll go up-stairs.” He was irritated by
her supreme indifference to the matter which he
had tried to bring to her attention. He meant to
have this thing out definitely.</p>

<p>She rushed away in advance of him so impetuously
that he paused and looked after her in
amazement. The furrow disappeared and he was
smiling.</p>

<p>And then the whole strange situation struck him
with renewed force. Was she really the daughter
of Thornburg, and was he afraid to claim her? Or
was there no connection at all between her and the
manager, and did he, Baron, hold the trump-cards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
in that game which meant the permanent possession
of her?</p>

<p>If she were Thornburg’s, why shouldn’t Mrs.
Thornburg frankly say to her husband: “I know
everything—but I still want her”? It occurred
to him that it might be his duty to suggest just
that course to her. But old habits of restraint
were too strong for him. After all, he didn’t know
the Thornburgs very well. He scarcely knew Mrs.
Thornburg at all.</p>

<p>Moreover, “it was a very pretty quarrel as it
stood.” He had been frank and aboveboard every
step of the way. If others could not or would not
be so, that was no concern of his.</p>

<p>He went up into the attic, which was made
golden by a flood of late afternoon sunlight. In
truth he found himself in an atmosphere that was
delightful in its warmth and aloofness and quietude.</p>

<p>Bonnie May hurried toward him, the manuscript
in her hands. She was trembling with
eagerness. A foolish little creature in some respects,
surely, thought Baron.</p>

<p>He glanced at the title-page and turned half a
dozen pages aimlessly. And when he glanced at
Bonnie May he was amazed by her expression of
wonder, of distress.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to be interested in it!” said
she.</p>

<p>“Not a great deal—just now. I’d have to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
into it, you know. When I’ve more time. Besides,”
he tossed the manuscript aside, “I’m deeply
interested in something else just now.”</p>

<p>She quickly evinced a pretty spirit of submission.
In response to his gesture she sat down near
the window, opposite him.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about you to-day. Seriously.”</p>

<p>“I hope I haven’t been queering anything?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. We’re all very much pleased
with you.”</p>

<p>There may have been something of patronage
in the tone. At any rate, she replied with a little
smile: “Thank you. You know an artist always
strives to please.” As he regarded her quietly she
added more earnestly: “It’s strange that I got
by, too, when you come to think about it. I was
hardly prepared to play a nice part when I came
here. Anyway, not a part where you have to have
so much—what the critics call restraint. You can
take it from me, the nice parts aren’t half as fat
as the nasty parts.”</p>

<p>He did not remove his eyes from her face. He
had the thought that she was very far away from
him, after all. From all of them. “I wish,” he
said, “you wouldn’t always talk as if you were
only taking part in a play. Somehow it doesn’t
seem quite friendly. We’re trying to make this a
real home for you. We’re trying to be real friends.
We’re trying to live a real life. Why not look at it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
that way when you’re with me? Wouldn’t that
seem friendlier?”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a little flicker of anxiety
in her eyes. “You see,” she said, “I can’t help
thinking all the time that everything I do must
be like a nice ingénue part, and being afraid that
you’ll come home some day and find I’ve been
doing some soubrette stuff.”</p>

<p>He shook his head and abruptly assumed a new
attitude. “Did you understand me clearly when
I said that Mrs. Thornburg wishes you to visit
her?”</p>

<p>“I think I didn’t pay much attention,” she admitted,
looking away from him. “Did you—wish
me to go?”</p>

<p>“I think it would be very nice. If you didn’t
like them, you needn’t ever go again.” He tried
to speak lightly.</p>

<p>She brought her eyes to his now, anxiously.
“When did you think I ought to go?” she asked.</p>

<p>Baron brought his chair down with a bump. “I
didn’t say you ought to go, exactly. Don’t put it
that way. I only thought it would be nice and
kind of you to go, because they wish it. I’d be
anxious to have you come back quite soon, of
course.”</p>

<p>“And—and mother: does she wish me to go,
too?”</p>

<p>Her use of that word brought warmth to his
heart. “She doesn’t wish it. Frankly, I think she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
wouldn’t like it at all. But I think she’d consent.”</p>

<p>She was greatly relieved. She leaned forward
and patted him on the knee. “I was afraid you
might be planning to cut down the company,” she
said.</p>

<p>He looked at her without comprehending readily.</p>

<p>“I mean,” she elaborated, “I thought maybe it
was a case of cold feet.”</p>

<p>He flinched. “Oh, Bonnie May!” was his disapproving
rejoinder.</p>

<p>“You mean it’s stale?” she asked. The expression
in her eyes was innocent, perplexed.</p>

<p>He slowly shook his head in despair, and then he
saw the swift look of comprehension that brightened
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know,” she said. “Knock-about talk!”</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and thrust his chair aside.
“For a few moments I would be very glad if we
might use the English language,” he said. “I was
hopeful of arriving at an understanding with you
on a certain simple proposition.”</p>

<p>She began to laugh unrestrainedly, after an instant
of shocked silence. She “stared him out of
countenance,” as the saying is. He had never
heard her laugh so hilariously. Yet even then he
could not be blind to the look of appeal in her
eyes—appeal, mingled with a defiant consciousness
of guilt.</p>

<p>Then she became grave and conciliatory. “I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
go,” she said. “It’s nothing, after all. I think I
get you. They’ve been after you, and you don’t
want to be bothered any more. I think we ought
to get it over with as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“We might go over this evening, immediately
after dinner,” he suggested.</p>

<p>She fidgeted. “But you know I’ll have to come
back to-morrow in time to practise my music lesson?”
she stipulated.</p>

<p>Here was the opportunity to prove his complete
fairness—to Thornburg. “There’s a piano over
there. You can practise there, if you care to.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m coming back. I have to take a lesson
from Flora, too—and give <i>her</i> a lesson.”</p>

<p>Baron didn’t know what she was talking about.</p>

<p>“Flora is giving me lessons in reading,” she explained.
“You know I’m to go to school next fall.”</p>

<p>“No one had mentioned it to me. But of course
you will. Everybody goes to school. And about
giving <i>her</i> a lesson?” he added weakly.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure I ought to talk about that. But
why not—to you? You see, I’m teaching her how
to laugh.”</p>

<p>Baron stared. “Teaching her how to <i>laugh</i>!” he
echoed.</p>

<p>She was immediately on the defensive. “I certainly
am. You must have seen that she doesn’t
know how!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You’re talking just plain nonsense!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“You might think so. A good many people
would. But I wish you would tell me how many
people you know who really laugh right.”</p>

<p>“Right! There’s no question of laughing <i>right</i>.
People laugh when there’s an occasion for laughing.”</p>

<p>“They don’t really laugh, because they don’t
know how. And very few people know anything
about the right occasion to laugh.”</p>

<p>“Meaning——”</p>

<p>“I can make it quite plain. You see, it’s a custom
to teach children how to talk, and some are
taught how to sing. I say nothing about the silly
things that are taught to ‘speak pieces,’ Heaven
help them. They are taught these things because
they wouldn’t know how to do them right if they
were left to themselves. They try to talk and
they try to sing, and they get it all wrong. And
then they are taught.”</p>

<p>“That’s an entirely different matter.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. When they try to laugh they get
it all wrong, too, but nobody thinks it’s necessary
to teach them any better. You can see I’m perfectly
right.”</p>

<p>“I think what you say is quite absurd.”</p>

<p>“It’s just new to you, that’s all. You know perfectly
well that when most people try to laugh what
they really do is to cackle, or giggle, or shriek, or make
horrible noises until they nearly choke. Women
try not to cry, because it makes them look ugly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
But just think how some people look when they
laugh. All they need is a few lessons at the right
time. Then they know how to laugh naturally
and freely. You have to think how you are doing
it at first. Afterward you laugh the right way
without thinking at all.”</p>

<p>“‘Ladies and gentlemen, I take pleasure in
introducing Mlle. Bonnie May, laughing expert,’”
said Baron derisively.</p>

<p>“A very fine argument,” responded Bonnie May,
nodding graciously. “And about the ‘occasion’ to
laugh,” she persisted seriously. “There’s a whole
lot to be said about that. You frame up a speech
with a lot of care—to get out of a scrape, or to make
people do something they don’t want to do—or for
something like that. You ought to laugh on the
same principle. Yet when most people tell you
about laughing at anything they put it this way:
‘I couldn’t help laughing!’ You know you smile
sometimes when you don’t mean it, just to help
things along; or you say you pity people, or you
say something to encourage them, for the same
reason. In the same way, you ought to laugh sometimes
when you’re not really amused. If you are
downhearted or afraid you can hide it by laughing.
And you can make people take a sensible
view of things sometimes, just by laughing at them.
But of course, you have to know how to do it right.
If you bray at them, or giggle, they’ll be insulted,
naturally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>Baron shook his head. “Where did you pick it
all up?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ‘pick it up,’ exactly. Miss Barry took
particular pains to teach it to me. On account of
my work mostly. And I thought a lot of it out for
myself.”</p>

<p>Before Baron had time to make any response to
her she sprang to her feet and picked up the neglected
manuscript. All her interests were immediately
centred in it.</p>

<p>She turned a dozen pages rapidly. Then she
paused in indecision and turned back a page or
two. She was anxiously searching.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” she cried. She was much relieved.
“Please read that to me.” She indicated a sentence.</p>

<p>Baron perceived that it was a longish passage—a
grandiloquent flight which he read shamefacedly.</p>

<p>She stopped him on the word “harbinger.”
“That’s the word,” she said. “Say that again.”</p>

<p>He complied.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” she wanted to know.</p>

<p>He had scarcely started to explain when she
exclaimed, “Oh, I see! Go on.”</p>

<p>A voice interrupted them: Mrs. Shepard, announcing
that dinner was ready.</p>

<p>On the way down-stairs Bonnie May amazed
Baron by repeating in its entirety the passage he
had read to her—“harbinger,” and all. “It’s pretty,
isn’t it?” said she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>In the lower hall Flora joined them. Baron
glanced at her mischievously. “I’ve been learning
a little something about the dark deeds that are
going on around me,” he said.</p>

<p>And Flora, as she preceded the other two into
the dining-room, lifted her face slightly and laughed
in a manner so musical and mellow that Baron
looked after her in amazement.</p>

<p>He felt Bonnie May’s hand tugging at his, and
looking at her he perceived that she had laid one
finger across her lips in warning.</p>

<p>He understood. He wanted to laugh, too. But
he realized that he did not know how, and that,
moreover, this was not the proper occasion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>AN EXIT AND AN ENTRANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was rather a pity that Bonnie May yielded to
an impulse to go out and have a little talk with
Mrs. Shepard after she had finished her dinner.</p>

<p>It was a pity, because she also yielded to an impulse
to talk confidentially to the sympathetic old
servant, and as a result she received an entirely
erroneous impression.</p>

<p>“I’m going away for a visit,” said Bonnie May,
by way of opening.</p>

<p>“A visit!” repeated Mrs. Shepard. “Why,
ain’t you here just for a visit?”</p>

<p>“Oh—yes! Of course!” was the response, given
rather blankly.</p>

<p>“You mean you’re going for a visit somewhere
else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I mean.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a time, while Bonnie May
tried to realize the full truth of what Mrs. Shepard
had said. Yes, she was merely a visitor in the
mansion, certainly. And they had probably been
regarding her in that light all the time.</p>

<p>A fear she had entertained earlier in the day recurred
to her. “And I expect they may be getting
tired of me,” she threw out tentatively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Mrs. Shepard was what is usually called a sensible
woman. “Oh, well,” she replied, “you know how
that is. When you are a visitor, people always
treat you politely, but, of course, they expect you
not to wear your welcome out.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” assented Bonnie May. She didn’t
permit Mrs. Shepard to see that she had suddenly
grown horribly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“You know, when people see too much of each
other, they—they get tired of each other,” added
the sensible servant.</p>

<p>“The most natural thing in the world,” agreed
Bonnie May. She felt that she suddenly hated
Mrs. Shepard with a dreadful hatred. She did
not at all realize that Mrs. Shepard was innocently
laying down a general proposition which she had
no thought of applying to any one in particular.</p>

<p>Still, she meant to behave graciously. “If I
should ever come back again, you won’t mind if
I come out and bake a little cake once in a while?”
she asked. She was achieving her most friendly
smile.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shepard turned toward her with energy.
“I certainly won’t,” she declared. There were no
general propositions in her mind now. She was
saying to herself: “Was there ever such a cunning
little thing?” “And I do hope you’ll come back—soon!”
she added.</p>

<p>Bonnie May nodded brightly and entered the
dining-room. She paused to adjust an article or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
two on the table. She tried to assume the manner
of one who is quite light-hearted. She was preparing
herself to play her part properly when she
joined the family up-stairs.</p>

<p>They were all assembled in the sitting-room, and
each was silent and self-centred when Baron dropped
the evening paper to the floor and addressed Bonnie
May when she entered the room, in the manner of
one who has forgotten something.</p>

<p>“You’re not ready to go with me to the Thornburgs’,”
he said. “You know we ought to be
starting before long.”</p>

<p>The effect of this casual utterance was quite
electrifying. The elder Baron dropped his paper,
also, and removed his glasses. Flora, searching
through a box of letters with some more or less
definite end in view, permitted several envelopes
with their contents to slip to the floor. She turned
a gaze of marked disfavor upon her brother. Mrs.
Baron merely swallowed with difficulty and looked
decidedly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Bonnie May felt the tension in the atmosphere.
They were trying to be nice and polite about it,
she decided. “I only have to put my hat on,” she
said. She succeeded wholly in creating the impression
that she was delighted with their planning,
as usual.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron arose with a little tremor in her
limbs. Her attitude became that of one who is
tenderly maternal and pathetically old. She bent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
over and took the child’s hands in hers. “My
dear,” she said, “are you quite sure you are willing
to go?”</p>

<p>Bonnie May looked into her eyes and smiled.
She was grateful for this proof of kindness. They
were the nicest people, truly! They weren’t going
to permit her to feel offended. “Oh, yes!” she said
brightly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron released her hands and turned away.</p>

<p>“I think it will be very nice to go,” added Bonnie
May. “You know, when people see too much of
one another, they—they get tired of one another!”</p>

<p>“I dare say!” responded Mrs. Baron. She was
determined the ungrateful little thing shouldn’t see
how wounded she was. “Well, if you’re to go to
the Thornburgs, I ought to see that you are presentable.”</p>

<p>She and the child disappeared, Mrs. Baron leading
the way and Bonnie May looking back over
her shoulder with a smile.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary!” said the elder Baron.</p>

<p>“She’s certainly a puzzle to me,” said Baron.
“Maybe the Thornburgs can do better with her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t judge her just by that one tactless
speech!” exclaimed Flora. “Don’t forget what a
little thing she is.”</p>

<p>Then silence fell in the room, and the typical
Baron existence was maintained until the mistress
of the house returned, guiding Bonnie May serenely
before her—Bonnie May in her best dress, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
a saucy straw hat decorated with silk pansies, and
with a ridiculous little hand-satchel depending from
her hooked forefinger.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Baron, leading the way toward
the stairs. He had an idea that words had better
be used sparingly.</p>

<p>But at the door the departing guest turned for
a last look, and instead of the masks of affable
politeness she expected to behold there was instead
a look of unmistakable regret on every face. Regret
which amounted to actual grief, so far as Mrs.
Baron and Flora were concerned.</p>

<p>Surely they weren’t glad to see her go! There
must be a mistake....</p>

<p>She clasped her hands and leaned forward in an
attitude of great earnestness. “You know how I
love you!” she cried. Her voice almost failed
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron came forward, all her resentment
gone. “Indeed, we do,” she declared. “There,
you’re not to go away feeling badly. I’m very
sorry you feel that you ought to go. And we’ll
be very anxious to have you come back as soon
as you possibly can.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you so much!” She lifted impulsive
arms to Mrs. Baron’s neck and hugged her. She
looked back at the others, and they could see that
there was happiness in her eyes as well as tears.</p>

<p>Then she was gone, in Baron’s wake. The sound
of her voice, anxiously questioning, drifted up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
stairs until it was suddenly quieted by the closing
of the front door.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ll have to go out on a street-car,”
said Baron. “When you want to come back, the
Thornburgs will probably send you in an automobile.”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands. “Fine!” said she.</p>

<p>Baron frowned—a fact which she remarked. “I
wasn’t thinking about the automobile,” she hastened
to assure him.</p>

<p>“Why the unconcealed rapture, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you might be starting out to
lose me, as you would a cat or a dog, you know.
I’m glad there’ll be a way for me to get back.”</p>

<p>Baron refused to see any humor in her remark.
“I wish you’d quit looking at it like that,” he said.
“Some day you’ll understand better why I think
it is a good thing for you to be friendly with the
Thornburgs. Just now you may rest assured that
we’re going to miss you.” He realized that he was
being rather serious, and he tried to end his observations
more cheerfully. “And whenever it
pleases you to honor us with your presence again,
you’ll find the latch-string, et cetera, et cetera.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was a very pleasant old garden at the
rear of the Thornburg residence—a fairly roomy
region of old trees and vines and rustic seats and
dreams. In the midst of this sylvan scene stood a
very old, friendly apple-tree, and beneath this, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
the evening dusk through which Baron and Bonnie
May were escorted out into the garden, sat Mrs.
Thornburg.</p>

<p>Thornburg had received them, and it was his
idea that it would be a fine thing for the two guests
to take Mrs. Thornburg unawares.</p>

<p>She regarded the visitors rather wearily at first
as they emerged from the shadows and stood before
her. Then she recognized Baron, and her face
brightened wonderfully. There was a child with
him, and of course it would be <i>the</i> child.</p>

<p>She arose from her many-cushioned seat and
leaned a little forward, while Bonnie May regarded
her with earnest eyes.</p>

<p>“You see, we’re here!” said Baron, trying to
strike a light and cheerful note.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornburg scarcely seemed to notice him.
“Yes,” she said dreamily. She did not remove her
eyes from Bonnie May’s.</p>

<p>It was the child who completed her scrutiny
first. She glanced about her appraisingly. “A
very beautiful exterior you have here,” she remarked,
somewhat loftily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornburg smiled rapturously at this. A
warm hue stole into her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you like it,” she said. She glanced
at Baron now, with joyous wonder in her eyes.
“We think it’s pretty,” she added. “It might make
you think of Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy-tales,
mightn’t it?” It was plain that she was feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
her way cautiously. “We might imagine we were
the children who played under the juniper-tree—though
I’m not sure an apple-tree would pass for
a juniper-tree.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May nodded amiably. “Or it might
remind you of a Shakespeare setting,” she suggested.</p>

<p>The woman regarded her anew with a look of
wonder, and pique, and delight; and then it was
evident that she had reached the limits of her restraint.
With hands that trembled she drew the
child slowly toward her, until she had the radiant
face pressed against her breast.</p>

<p>“Dear child, do try to love me, won’t you?”
she pleaded, and Baron saw that her face twitched,
and that her eyes were offering a prayer to the soft
sky in which the first stars of evening were just
blossoming.</p>

<p>Then, almost stealthily, he left them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Baggot was waiting for him in front of the house
when he reached home. To be exact, the young
playwright was sitting on the front step, nervously
puffing a cigarette.</p>

<p>“What took you out this time in the evening?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“I’ve been taking Bonnie May for a visit.”</p>

<p>“Oh!—her. I wanted to ask you. Who is she?”
Baron was unlocking the door. “Her name is
Bonnie May,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Oh, I know that. I mean, who is she? A
grandchild, or something?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any grandchildren. Suppose we go
into the house.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I shouldn’t know who she is.
It seems a pity to me that you can’t say something.”
Baggot threw his cigarette into the street
and followed Baron into the house and up into the
attic. Arrived there he renewed his attack.</p>

<p>“While it seems improbable that you can add
anything to the very explicit account you have
given me of Bonnie May, I’d like to say that I’m
curious to know who she is.”</p>

<p>Baron turned upon him quietly. “In view of
your unchallengeable right to ask questions about a
guest who happens to be in this house, I will explain
that she is an actress by profession, and that being
out of an engagement just now, she is accepting our
hospitality.”</p>

<p>Baggot was undisturbed. He exclaimed: “Well,
I thought——!”</p>

<p>“You thought——?”</p>

<p>“That I recognized her! Her ways, I mean.
You could tell there was something about her....”</p>

<p>“Well,” concluded Baron, “now let’s see what’s
up.” He had turned on the light, and now he
shoved a chair in Baggot’s direction.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the play?” demanded
Baggot.</p>

<p>“I haven’t read it yet.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_fp252">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fp252.jpg" alt="Dear child, do try to love me, won’t you?">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“Dear child, do try to love me, won’t you?”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Baggot laughed lamely and his whole bearing
expressed contempt. “You don’t seem to be at
all excited about it!” he complained.</p>

<p>Baron made no response to that. He was wondering
where Baggot got his enthusiasm for things.</p>

<p>“Well, the point is,” continued the other, “I’ve
got a producer, and it’s to be put on right away.
Over at the Palace. They’ve got a summer stock
company, you know. They’re going to give it a
trial performance.”</p>

<p>Baron was surprised. “I congratulate you,” he
said. “I supposed such things were pretty hard to
manage.”</p>

<p>Baggot explained with complete frankness. “I
know that. You see, I’ve got an uncle who is
financially interested in the Palace. He’s got confidence
in me—in this play, anyway. He made
them give me a trial. And that’s all I ask for. It’ll
go like wild-fire. You’ll see.”</p>

<p>He had lighted another cigarette and was puffing
nervously. “Where is it?” he demanded. And
when the manuscript was placed in his hands he
drew nearer to the light. With smoke curling up
into his eyes he began to read aloud. He held his
head askew, to escape the smoke.</p>

<p>Baron leaned back, his face in shadow, and
curiously studied the intense manner of his companion.</p>

<p>Baggot read: fitfully, speedily, with an occasional
aside, which he dropped entirely when he got well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
into the action of the drama. There was something
of impersonation in his manner as he read
now one character’s lines and now another’s. He
put so much interest into the reading that it seemed
almost like acting. And presently Baron began to
see vivid pictures. He was carried into a strange,
pleasant atmosphere. He was delighted by quaint,
unexpected bits of dialogue. He perceived, little
by little, the trend of the whimsical philosophy.</p>

<p>He could scarcely believe that this was Baggot’s
work. He forgot to take account of time. And
when the last act was finished, he found that he
had risen to his feet.</p>

<p>“Splendid!” he exclaimed. “Splendid!”</p>

<p>Baggot thrust the manuscript from him and
turned to the other with brilliant, triumphant eyes.</p>

<p>“No fault to find with that,” he challenged. In
another moment he had left the room, and was
hurrying down the stairs and away from the house,
too excited to contain himself.</p>

<p>The manuscript remained where it had fallen.</p>

<p>Late the next afternoon Baron returned from a
day’s work in the <i>Times</i> office.</p>

<p>He was thinking of Baggot’s play. He meant
to read it for himself—to see how much he had been
influenced the day before by Baggot’s almost
hypnotic enthusiasm.</p>

<p>He went up into the attic room—and there,
much to his amazement and delight, he was confronted
by Bonnie May.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>She blushed with confusion and looked at him
almost guiltily.</p>

<p>“Back so soon!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Why, it seemed to me I was away quite a long
time.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes—I suppose I’ve been rather busy.”
He looked about for the manuscript, which seemed
to have been removed. “Did you find it pleasant
at the Thornburgs’?” he asked. He was succeeding
now in getting back his habitual, quiet manner.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Quite pleasant.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice. I somehow imagined they might
persuade you to stay a little longer.”</p>

<p>“No, when I said I ought to be coming home,
she sent to the garage and had the automobile
brought around for me.”</p>

<p>Baron nodded. “And she wasn’t disappointed,
then?”</p>

<p>“She was very nice about it. She asked me to
come again. She told the man that any time I
telephoned to him he might come with the machine
and get me—here, you know. Any afternoon. It
seems Mr. Thornburg never uses the machine in
the afternoons, and she doesn’t care for it herself.
She was just as nice as she could be. And of course
I’m going back. But you know I really belong here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” assented Baron. “Yes, I
understand that.” He was still a bit puzzled.
He added tentatively: “Wasn’t everything very
beautiful there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“Beautiful? In what way?”</p>

<p>“The house—the grounds—everything.”</p>

<p>“Oh—the settings! Yes, they were quite pretentious.
But they never count for so much, really.
It is the action and the dialogue that really count.
And I like the action and the dialogue here much
better.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>BAGGOT’S PLAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you are told that you have only to telephone
to a certain garage, and a very fine, large automobile
will be sent around to your house, entirely
at your service, a very strong temptation has been
placed in your way.</p>

<p>Bonnie May could scarcely believe that she could
achieve so much by a mere word or two over the
telephone, and it was not at all surprising that she
experimented within a day or two after her first
visit to the Thornburg home.</p>

<p>The automobile came with almost incredible
promptness, and a chauffeur who had the gallant
bearing of a soldier did everything but fling a cloak
on the ground for Bonnie May to walk on.</p>

<p>She called rather briefly and formally on Mrs.
Thornburg on this occasion, but the experience
had its special, delighting excitements. The experiment
was repeated frequently, and the truth
must be recorded that before long Bonnie May
was spending her time more or less equally between
the mansion and the Thornburg home.</p>

<p>She became something of a personage during
those days.</p>

<p>Baggot called on Baron one afternoon, and upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
being informed that Baron was out, he asked for
Bonnie May, and spent fully an hour with her,
leaving her in a high state of complacency.</p>

<p>The next day he called again, and this time he
did not ask for Baron. He came, he said, to call
on Bonnie May.</p>

<p>But this time she was not in. She spent a good
part of her time as the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Thornburg,
Baggot was told—which indicates clearly
enough how the status of affairs had changed.</p>

<p>Baggot made a note of this information and went
away in a thoughtful mood.</p>

<p>The members of the Baron family considered
these developments without commenting upon them
very much at first. But one day Baron, Sr., took
occasion to express an opinion.</p>

<p>“It seems strange to have a mere infant passing
between two houses like a bird between two trees,”
he said. This was thought to be his mild way of
expressing disapproval.</p>

<p>“It’s Victor’s arrangement,” replied Mrs. Baron.
This response was made less inadequate by the
way her eyebrows went up.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” declared Flora, “we’ve all fallen
in love with the saucy little thing.”</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired Mrs. Baron truculently.</p>

<p>“I mean, I don’t think Victor’s idea is a bad one
at all. She’s—well, the kind that do extraordinary
things when they grow up. We may be glad enough
to be in a position where we can ‘get from under’
one of these days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“I’m thinking of our responsibility,” was her
mother’s rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Yes, so am I. Suppose she made up her mind
to be an actress again? The Thornburgs would
be just the right kind of friends for her if she did—and
Victor says they are very good people. But
having an actress in the house—in <i>our</i> house—would
be like having a cub bear for a pet. They’re cunning
enough when they’re little, but there comes a
time when you have to telephone the zoo, or turn
in a riot call.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed!” cried Mrs. Baron.
“I’m sure she’s a good child—a very good child.”</p>

<p>The word “reconstruction” came to Flora’s
mind, but she didn’t say anything about it. She
only smiled, rather tantalizingly, and added: “Just
the same, I believe in cyclone cellars.”</p>

<p>So it became no uncommon thing for a huge car
to stop before the mansion. “For me!” Bonnie
May would exclaim on these occasions; whereupon
she would hurry into jacket and hat, and eagerly
clasp Mrs. Baron and Flora about the neck, and
hurry with real childish eagerness as far as the
front door, after which she would demurely cross
the sidewalk and take her place in the car with the
air of any sedate lady of fashion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The first little unpleasantness between Bonnie
May and Baron arose very soon after this series
of irregular exits and entrances began.</p>

<p>“While I think of it,” said Baron casually, addressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the child, “I want to provide a—a fund for
you.” He smiled amiably. “See?” He took a
quantity of change from his pocket and placed it
in a vase. “Whenever you go calling it will be
proper for you to put something into your purse.
For tips, perhaps. Or for something of that kind.
I am sure a young lady ought to have a little
money.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May looked curiously into his smiling
face, which seemed to have been transformed for
the moment into a mask. “I don’t believe I would
bother about that,” she replied.</p>

<p>“I’m not bothering.” Baron’s smile stiffened
slightly. “I merely wish you to have what you
want.”</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Thornburg always gives me money.”</p>

<p>The smile vanished. “That’s very good of Mrs.
Thornburg, certainly. But when you are in our
house you won’t need her money. When you’re
starting out, from this end of the route, you’ll find
money in the vase.”</p>

<p>She looked at him intently, not quite understanding
the unfriendly note in his voice. “I believe
you are jealous!” she said.</p>

<p>“You see too much,” rejoined Baron resentfully.</p>

<p>“It isn’t that. You show too much!”</p>

<p>“Of course, I ought to be grateful for criticism
from such a source!”</p>

<p>She regarded him with wonder, her eyes filling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
with tears. “You’ve no right to speak to me like
that. You know I don’t need any money. You
have all been so generous.... And it’s only because
Mrs. Thornburg isn’t well, and because I
don’t know her as well as I know you that I took
money from her. She was so happy giving it to
me. It would have been rude for me to refuse.
But here—here I’ve been with friends!”</p>

<p>She brushed the tears from her eyes and ran from
the room. As in other times of stress, Mrs. Shepard
and the kitchen became her refuge.</p>

<p>Baron looked after her with an assumption of
idle curiosity, but when he heard a distant door
close his expression changed to real concern. He
was dismayed when he thought how deeply he had
wounded the child. He was aware of a sudden
resentment against the Thornburgs. He sat down
and gazed abstractedly at the carpet. He realized
after a time that he was studying the meaningless
outlines of a figure in faded colors. “We need a
new carpet,” he mused. “We need everything
new. And the only new thing we’ve got hold of
in years is discovering that everything in the house,
including ourselves, is threadbare, and respectable—and
ugly.”</p>

<p>Then he realized that Bonnie May had come
back into the room and that she was almost impatiently
trying to thrust her hand into his.</p>

<p>“Oh, do let’s play nice parts,” she remonstrated.
“You know, if you once start in melodrama it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
the hardest thing in the world to get into anything
better.”</p>

<p>He leaned back and clasped his hands behind
his head. “I think I make rather a silly villain,”
he admitted.</p>

<p>“You see, I know what troubled you. I thought
it out. You thought I could care more for the
things the Thornburgs do for me than I do for
the lovely way you took me in here and were good
to me. Wasn’t that it?”</p>

<p>“Why, something like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s silly. Politeness—that’s all it’s
been with them. But the way you took me in, and
treated me, and everything.... You don’t think
I could be such a little beast as not to understand
all that, do you?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was no other friction for many days. Indeed,
Bonnie May was less frequently absent when
Baron came into the house from his journeys about
the city. She seemed after all to be developing only
a limited interest in the Thornburgs.</p>

<p>Besides, Baron had a new interest thrust upon
him. Baggot had arrived at a point in the development
of his play which made him an incessant
nuisance to all his acquaintances, and to Baron
most of all. He could talk of nothing but his drama—“The
Break of Day,” it was called—and he insisted
upon consulting Baron, or inviting his admiration
and approval, half a dozen times a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Rehearsals had begun over at the Palace, and
the process of cutting, and elaborating, and altering,
was almost driving Baggot mad. Mad with
resentment, sometimes; or mad with excitement
and anticipations.</p>

<p>“You’ll review it for one of the papers, won’t
you?” he demanded of Baron on one occasion,
indicating by manner and tone that a refusal was
out of the question.</p>

<p>“How can I tell?” retorted Baron. “I’ll have
to wait until I’m asked.”</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to that.” He was blind to Baron’s
contemptuous and sceptical grin. “And I’ll want
to extend courtesies to your family, if you don’t
mind. A box. You know it helps a lot to have the
right kind of people at a <i>première</i>.” He perceived
something in Baron’s eyes which disquieted him.
“I mean,” he added, “I want to get the opinion of
the right kind of people.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Baron. “Of course I can’t
answer for the family. They might like to come.
They will appreciate the invitation, in any event.”
He was wondering why he had ever permitted Baggot
to get acquainted with him. Then, afraid that
Baggot would read this thought in his eyes, he
added evasively: “Bonnie May appears to be the
real theatregoer of the family. She will want to
come, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bonnie May!” Baggot seemed to be
brushing the name aside. “It’s the <i>family</i> I want.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
I have a reason. Be sure not to fail me.” He
seemed to remember something in connection with
the work over at the Palace. In a moment he was
gone, without a word of farewell.</p>

<p>He was utterly childish, Baron thought, and
certainly it was wrong to disappoint children needlessly.</p>

<p>Yes, he would really try to persuade the family
to go.</p>

<p>When occasion arose to speak to Bonnie May
alone he tried to make light of the whole affair.
“A great honor,” he began, “for you and all of
us. A box has been reserved for us for the first
performance of ‘The Break of Day.’”</p>

<p>Bonnie May clapped her hands. “How fine!”
she said. “Do you think they will all go?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know. Really, it doesn’t seem very
important—does it?—a first performance, in a
summer theatre, by an unknown company!”</p>

<p>She seemed anxious. “Anyway, I do hope
mother will go.”</p>

<p>Baron thought he understood that. If “mother”
refused to go, she might not be permitted to go
herself.</p>

<p>However, he approached his mother on the subject
with a certain amount of earnestness. “I’ve
had a sort of hand in the play, in a small way,”
he explained. “And Baggot is anxious to have
us all come.” He couldn’t resist the temptation
to add: “He places a high value on the opinion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
what he calls nice people. That means us. You
can’t seem indifferent to such recognition, can
you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron was deaf to the sarcasm. “Isn’t
it one of those cheap summer theatres?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, but really I don’t know that it will be
very different from the winter performances. Not
as an ethical proposition, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think I’d be interested,” she decided.
However, she did not speak with her usual certainty,
and she glanced at her son a bit anxiously.
If he really wanted her to go....</p>

<p>On a later occasion Baron again touched the
subject. He had just got rid of Baggot, who was
in an unusually enthusiastic mood.</p>

<p>“Really, mother, I have an idea that play is
going to be quite worth while. If you didn’t mind
it very much....”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Baron fancied she was being coerced.
“No, I think not,” she said, shaking her head.</p>

<p>“And Bonnie May,” added Baron. “Great
goodness, how anxious she is to go! I suppose she
thinks she can’t go unless you do.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron’s eyes flashed. That was it! Bonnie
May’s comfort and pleasure—that, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>“I remember that argument,” she said, rather
disagreeably. “You forget that she has other
friends now—rather better suited to her needs in
this case. The Thornburgs can take her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>But Baron, noting the uncomfortable look in
her eyes, left her with the conclusion, unexpressed:
“My bet is that the Thornburgs will <i>not</i> take
her.”</p>

<small>BARON COMES HOME ON A BEER-DRAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron</span> was not at all confident that any of the
dramatic editors would want him to write a review
of “The Break of Day.” He merely hoped his
services might be required. And he was disappointed.</p>

<p>He might have had the assignment for the asking,
perhaps; but he felt a hesitancy about asking.
He had “fathered” the play, somewhat. He had
a personal interest in it.</p>

<p>Moreover, there was one reason why he was glad
to be disengaged. Now he could attend the performance
as an ordinary spectator, and he could
take Bonnie May with him.</p>

<p>The day of the first performance arrived. Baron
left the mansion early in the forenoon, more for
the purpose of escaping the half-insane Baggot
than for any other reason. Baggot didn’t really
believe that Baron could help him, perhaps, but his
nature demanded that he talk about his play all
the time, and Baron listened well.</p>

<p>Bonnie May was not about when Baron left the
mansion. He had had no final understanding with
her as to whether she was to go to the theatre that
night or not. And it was for this reason that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
coming home in a particularly eager mood, late in
the afternoon, to tell her that he was foot-loose,
and that she might depend upon him as an escort
to the theatre.</p>

<p>He was coming home with much eagerness—and
then an accident happened.</p>

<p>He started to alight from the cross-town car before
it stopped, and his foot struck a loose fragment
of stone, and he lost his balance. Thinking
of the matter afterward, he decided that he could
not recall an experience more banal, more needless.
But he did not reach this conclusion at the time,
for the good reason that his head struck the pavement
and he lost consciousness. There had been
just one instant of sharp agony.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes presently to find himself
supported by two men. Every passenger in the
crowded car, which had stopped, was staring at
him. A crowd of pedestrians had also stopped to
see what had happened.</p>

<p>He looked dazedly at the two men who were supporting
him. One was the car-conductor, whose
eyes expressed fear and disgust. The other man’s
appearance was in some degree familiar to Baron.
He was gigantic, ruddy, wholly self-possessed.</p>

<p>Baron wondered who this man was, and then,
as his gaze roved weakly from point to point, he
saw a red beer-dray—and he knew. This was the
beer-driver whom he and Bonnie May had watched
and discussed one day from the attic window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“He’s all right,” declared the beer-driver, getting
a firmer grip on Baron’s arm.</p>

<p>Baron was greatly relieved to hear that he was
“all right.” He had his doubts. The back of his
head seemed to be asleep, and there was a horrible
pain in his left leg when he tried to touch the
pavement with his foot.</p>

<p>“I’ll want your name and address, and the names
of witnesses,” said the conductor. He had produced
a little note-book.</p>

<p>“You don’t need them,” declared Baron. “It
was my own fault. I don’t want to be detained
here.”</p>

<p>“But the rules require—” said the conductor.</p>

<p>“Just forget the rules,” advised the beer-driver,
who perceived that Baron meant what he said.
And in an instant Baron was feeling a new sort
of embarrassment, because the ruddy giant of the
beer-dray had picked him up in his arms, and was
taking long strides in the direction of his dray.
“Out of the way!” he ordered, and people obeyed.</p>

<p>Baron had the helpless sensation of one who
rides on an elephant. He thought he realized now
just what it must be to perform the tasks of a mahout.
“Though I don’t seem to need an ankus—yet,”
he meditated. Baron had read his Kipling.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to trouble you,” he said, speaking in
a general downward direction.</p>

<p>“You’re not troubling me,” came back the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>The driver had reached his dray, and greatly to
Baron’s amazement, he put a foot on the hub of
the wheel, a disengaged hand on the iron bar surrounding
the back of the seat, and had vaulted
into a sitting posture, carrying his burden with him.</p>

<p>It seemed to Baron that he had been swung
through limitless space, as if he had been a star,
held to its place by gravity. He held his hat in
place, as he might have done if a cyclone had seized
him in its clutch. And with such attention as he
could command he was observing the performance
of the driver.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” commanded that individual: needlessly,
for already Baron was by his side, holding
on to the iron bar at the back of the seat, and
feeling uncomfortably light and dizzy. His companion
looked into his eyes. “A pretty hard jolt,”
he said, thrusting a protecting arm about his charge.
“Gee-app!” He pulled the reins dexterously with
the aid of thumb and little finger, and the horses
began to move.</p>

<p>Much to Baron’s surprise, the driver did not
ask him where he lived, but quietly turned his
horses’ heads in the right direction, adjusting the
brake with his foot, and glancing ahead to see that
the right of way was clear.</p>

<p>Baron’s mind reverted to Bonnie May for an
instant, and he remembered that she had noted
how the driver had held his reins with authority,
and sat with his great legs planted purposefully
before him. Yes, that was precisely right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“You haven’t asked me where I live,” he remarked,
trying to be partly independent of his
companion’s support.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to. I know.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed you before now. You’re one of
the Barons.”</p>

<p>The injured man felt flattered. Still, he reflected,
the driver might have noticed him for any
number of unflattering reasons. For a moment he
tried to fathom this thought: Was it an evidence
that the driver was simple and stupid, that he had
interested himself in the people who lived in his
neighborhood? He couldn’t reach a satisfactory
conclusion.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully good of you to give me a lift like
this,” he remarked. He was beginning to feel a
little less shaken and strange.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. You’d do as much for me,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Carry you around and lift you up on a high
seat?” asked Baron incredulously.</p>

<p>The driver threw back his immense head, revealing
a bronzed, bull-like throat from which a sound
like thunder came. “Well, no, I guess you wouldn’t
do <i>that</i>,” he admitted.</p>

<p>The horses, with their ears turned alternately
toward the driver and pointed ahead, were brought
to a halt in front of the mansion.</p>

<p>“Now you sit up here and hold tight, and try
to look as if nothing had happened,” directed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
driver. He removed his arm and sprang to the
pavement.</p>

<p>“Why?” Baron wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I want to call your old lady out, so she can see
you sitting up on the seat.”</p>

<p>Baron frowned. “Why?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“If I’d carry you to the door and ring the bell,
she’d have a fit when she came out. She’s pretty
high-strung, anyway.” It was as if he were describing
a woman of his own household, instead of
Baron’s.</p>

<p>“Oh!” responded Baron. He was thinking that
it was difficult to know where to expect chivalry in
one form or another, and that there were various
ways of manifesting it. “I believe you’re right,”
he added.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Baron who came to the door in response
to a ring. It is not improbable that she
had been looking out of the upper window.</p>

<p>“Your son wants to speak to you,” said the
driver, dragging off his German cap and revealing
a shock of dishevelled hair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron seemed to ignore the man utterly.
She stood, pale and rigid, staring at Baron. She
comprehended at least one thing: he had driven
up to the door of the mansion in a beer-dray.</p>

<p>Then she smiled ominously. “What a quaint
idea!” said she, passing the driver and descending
the steps. “Of course, this is one of your
jokes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>She paused then. She had swiftly become less
assured in her anger.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a mean fall, mother,” said Baron,
trying to keep a martyr-like tone out of his voice.
“I’m afraid I’ll have to be carried into the house.
This man was good enough to bring me home. He
was afraid of alarming you. It was his idea that
you ought to be notified before he carried me in.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t understand!” There was swift,
childlike remorse in her bearing. “It was kind of
you,” she added to the driver, by way of atonement
for her rudeness. She regarded him with
flickering eyes. She could not help shrinking from
the warm, gross bulk of the man, yet she admired
him somewhat as a lamb might admire a benevolent
bull that has just driven a wolf away.</p>

<p>She went as far as the curb and looked up at
Baron critically. Yes, he was seriously injured.
Something told her that. A strained expression
about his lips and eyes, perhaps, and his attitude.</p>

<p>She turned anxiously to the driver. “Do you
suppose you can get him in without any help?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Sure!” The driver derived no joy from her
sudden discomfiture—in the sudden levelling of her
high spirit to the lowly plane of a fearful mother.
Perhaps he did not realize that she had been wrathful
toward her son, and rude to him. “You go and
push the door open and get things ready.” He
approached Baron and held his arms up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>Baron put his hands on the immense fellow’s
shoulders, and again he experienced that sensation
of being swung through space. In an instant he
was being borne up his own front steps.</p>

<p>“Can you carry him up-stairs?” inquired Mrs.
Baron dubiously.</p>

<p>“Why not?” And up the stairs the driver proceeded,
without the slightest evident effort.</p>

<p>At the top Mrs. Baron led the way into Baron’s
old room—now Bonnie May’s. But the driver
paused on the threshold, leisurely casting his eyes
over the evidences of feminine proprietorship.</p>

<p>“You’d better let me take him to his own room,
mother,” he declared decisively. He seemed quite
unconscious of bearing a burden. He was woodenly
indifferent to Baron’s efforts to get down.</p>

<p>“But that’s up another flight,” was Mrs. Baron’s
faltering response.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You see, I’m used to delivering
beer-barrels, and they always find they save
trouble if they let me put ’em just where they belong.”</p>

<p>Baron, thinking of the difficulties which might
arise when this willing and capable Atlas was gone,
quite agreed with the suggestion. “I’m sure he’s
right, mother,” he said, “if he doesn’t mind.”</p>

<p>Up another flight Baron was borne, and at the
top the driver turned about haltingly, but still
seemingly unaware of having his strength taxed,
and called down: “You better see about getting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
doctor, mother. He’ll need to have himself looked
after. I can put him to bed.”</p>

<p>Baron was able to grin weakly at the driver’s
simple generalship—and at the fact that his mother
obeyed with nervous promptitude. “That way,”
said he, pointing, and then he essayed a little joke.
“I think you forgot to carry me around the block
a time or two before you started up here, didn’t
you?” he asked the driver.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing,” came back the response.
“If I had a twelve-year-old boy who didn’t weigh
more than you do, I’d drown him.”</p>

<p>With this the attic room was entered, and Baron
was placed carefully on a chair. Then his shoes
and other garments were removed with caution,
and before he quite realized what had happened, he
was in bed.</p>

<p>“I wish I had your strength,” he said, feeling
that such service as he had received ought to be
acknowledged somehow.</p>

<p>“What? Oh, you’d better leave that to me.
I need it and you don’t. I guess that’s about the
only thing I’ve got.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t. You’ve got the right kind of a
heart, too.”</p>

<p>This created instant embarrassment. By way of
escape from praise, the big fellow whispered loudly:
“Say the word and I’ll jump out and get a bucket
of beer before the mother gets back.”</p>

<p>“Beer!” exclaimed Baron. He had always associated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
beer with festive occasions, and he was
quite sure the present moment was not a festive
occasion. “I don’t believe I care for any beer—just
now.” He believed he had achieved a commendably
diplomatic stroke by adding the two last
words. He was prompted to add: “But if you’re
sure your horses won’t get restless, I’d be glad to
have you stay until mother comes.”</p>

<p>The driver sat down, selecting a straight-backed
chair, and holding himself so upright that he made
Baron think of a huge, benevolent heathen god.
He had dropped his cap to the floor beside him,
and his hands were clasped about his capacious
stomach. There was now a restful placidity as
well as extraordinary power in his presence.</p>

<p>“And it isn’t just your strength that I envy,”
said Baron, catching the luminous blue eyes of the
driver for an instant, “it’s the generous way you’ve
got of treating a fellow as if he were a brother!”</p>

<p>This, too, created great embarrassment. The
driver’s face flamed and he struggled to get away
from anything resembling praise. “Yes, sir!” he
exclaimed, as if he were merely continuing, “that
bay horse would stand in his tracks until I came
back, even if the owner of the brewery tried to
drive him away.”</p>

<p>Baron laughed. “Well, I won’t say anything
more to your credit, if you don’t want to hear it,”
he said. But after a moment’s silence he went on,
more seriously than he had yet spoken, “but do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
tell me, for my own good, how you manage to feel
so well disposed toward people—toward everybody!”</p>

<p>“Who, me? Oh, I just drink a bucket of beer
every time I get thirsty, and every time I begin to
feel mean I go out and dance with the girls pretty
near all night. The bigger they are the easier I
swing ’em.” He leaned back and laughed until
things in the room shook. A book fell off the table.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron came in with the doctor then, and
it remained for her to make the mistake which
Baron had avoided.</p>

<p>“You must let me pay you for your trouble,”
she said. “I don’t know what would have happened
but for you.”</p>

<p>But the extraordinary creature grasped his cap
in both hands and reddened again. “Who, me?”
he said. “Oh, no, mother. I make mine flirting
with beer-barrels.” He made his exit uneasily.
They heard him whistling on the stairs. In the
distance the front door closed with a bang.</p>

<p>“What an extraordinary creature!” exclaimed
Mrs. Baron.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Baron, “I’m afraid he is—extraordinary.”</p>

<p>He was remembering something about the misleading
effects of a make-up. Surely this big fellow’s
immense body and his rough speech were
only a make-up, after all, hiding those qualities
which even from the standpoint of a Baron were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
most to be sought and cherished! That was what
Bonnie May had tried to impress upon him.</p>

<p>Then, with sudden anxiety, Baron turned to his
mother. “Where is Bonnie May?” he asked.</p>

<p>“She went away this afternoon,” was the response.
Mrs. Baron avoided her son’s eyes. She
spoke rather guiltily.</p>

<p>“She went away,” Baron mused disconsolately.
“And it was to-night she was so eager to have
somebody take her to see ‘The Break of Day.’”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>BONNIE MAY HIDES SOMETHING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron</span> made a wry face when he was told by Doctor
Percivald that he had a very badly sprained ankle,
and that he would have to remain on his back indefinitely.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t it have been something less—ladylike?”
he wanted to know. But Doctor Percivald,
being a scientific-minded person, merely glanced
at him impatiently and said nothing.</p>

<p>However, he speedily discovered that being an
invalid on what might be considered a preferred
plan was not without its compensations.</p>

<p>He became the pivot around which the affairs
of the household revolved. He was constantly
being considered and deferred to. It had been so
long since any member of the family had been disabled
that his affliction, being very limited in extent,
was looked upon as a sort of luxury.</p>

<p>However, though the family gathered about his
bed occasionally to hold pleasant discussions, there
were times when he lay alone—and these were the
most profitable if not the most pleasant hours of all.</p>

<p>The noises of the street, pleasantly muffled,
reached him; movements in the house were faintly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
audible and pleasantly homely; the sun shone with
a lonely brilliance against his walls.</p>

<p>During such periods he took an inventory of life
from a new angle. He sat in judgment upon himself
like a disinterested person. Baron, disabled,
critically surveyed Baron, able to be about.</p>

<p>“Spendthrift of time and chance—that’s what
you are,” decided Baron, disabled, directing his
condemnation against Baron, well and sound.
“You’ve been thinking all the time that to be
Baron was something fine. You haven’t had sense
enough to realize that merely being Baron wasn’t
being anything at all. You’ve got to realize that
all men must be measured by just one standard.
You’ve got to quit thinking it’s right for you to
do just the pleasant things—the things you like to
do. You have got to go to work, and take orders
like any other man.”</p>

<p>Lying in his room, he obtained a new impression
of Bonnie May, too.</p>

<p>She did not return to the mansion on the day
of his accident. He thought she might possibly do
so after the theatre hour, but the evening passed
and in due time there were the sounds of the house
being closed for the night, and languid voices calling
to one another on the floor below.</p>

<p>The first long night passed, with occasional tapping
on the invalid’s door by Mrs. Baron. A dozen
times during the night she came to see if he needed
anything, to be sure that he rested comfortably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Finally he chided her gayly for disturbing him
and herself; then, after another interval which
seemed only of a few minutes, he opened his eyes
again to respond to the tapping on the door, and
discovered that the sun was shining into the room.
It was quite late in the forenoon.</p>

<p>“I’ve come with the papers,” said Flora, approaching
his bed like a particularly lovely ministering
angel. “Mother’s lying down. She didn’t
sleep very well last night.”</p>

<p>Baron had the odd thought that people must
look entirely different if you looked at them while
you were lying down. Never before had Flora
seemed so serene and beautiful and richly endowed
with graces of person and voice. He was so pleased
with this view of her that he decided not to lift
his head.</p>

<p>Then, while she arranged the papers, unconscious
of his scrutiny, he read an expression in her
eyes which brought him abruptly to his elbow.</p>

<p>“Flora,” he declared, “you’re not happy!”</p>

<p>She laughed softly as if to ridicule such a suggestion,
but immediately there was a delicate flush
in her face. “Nonsense!” she said. “And somebody
helpless in the house to worry about? One
wouldn’t dance and sing under the circumstances.
I’m trying to behave becomingly—that’s all.”</p>

<p>Baron disregarded this. “And as soon as I get
up,” he said, “I’m going to see that certain nonsense
is ended. He’s a dandy good fellow—that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
what he is. I can’t imagine what we’ve all been
thinking about.”</p>

<p>“He—” Flora began properly enough, but
the conventional falsehood she meant to utter
failed to shape itself. She couldn’t return her
brother’s glance. It occurred to her that the window-shade
needed adjusting.</p>

<p>“I’m going to put a stop to certain nonsense,”
Baron repeated. He rattled the newspapers with
decision, covertly regarding his sister, who did
not trust herself to speak again. She kept her
eyes averted as she left the room.</p>

<p>Flora had opened all the papers so that the
dramatic reviews came uppermost, and as Baron
glanced from one to another he forgot Flora completely.
By the time he had glanced at the fifth
review of the production of “The Break of Day”
he dropped the papers and drew a long breath.
“Holy Smoke!” he exclaimed, and then he returned
to his reading.</p>

<p>Baggot’s play had scored an almost unprecedented
success. Several of the dramatic critics
had written signed articles in which they expressed
unbounded praise. And from his knowledge of
newspaper writing, Baron knew that even the most
hardened of theatregoers had been swept off their
feet by the charm and novelty of the new play.</p>

<p>Baron gathered that a new actress had been
added to the group of notable American artists
as a result of the creation of the part of “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
Sprite.” But when he sought from one account to
another for the name of this player, he found only
that the rôle of “The Sprite” had been played
“By Herself.” He couldn’t find her name anywhere,
or anything about her.</p>

<p>But after all, the identity of even a very successful
player was not the thing Baron was thinking
of most. He was delighted that Baggot had been
successful. It seemed that Baggot had “arrived.”</p>

<p>His reflections were interrupted by his mother.
She entered the room rather hurriedly. Baron
realized that something must have happened, or
she wouldn’t have come in like that, rubbing her
eyes sleepily and wearing a loose wrapper.</p>

<p>“They’re telephoning for you down at the newspaper
office,” she yawned. “I didn’t tell them
you were—that you couldn’t.... I thought maybe
you might like to do some writing in bed, if they
want you to.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not going to do any writing in bed.
I feel as if that is what I’ve been doing always.
I’m going to wait until I can get up, and then I’m
going to work in earnest.”</p>

<p>She regarded him dubiously, not understanding
at all. “And what shall I say?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Tell them I’m laid up, and that I’ll be down to
see them as soon as I’m able to be about.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“And mother—don’t say I’ve got a sprained
ankle. Think of something else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Something else——” Mrs. Baron succeeded
now in opening her eyes to their normal width.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t sound very impressive. Everybody
sprains his ankle. You might say I’ve broken
my leg, if you can’t think of anything else.”</p>

<p>“A sprained ankle is a sprained ankle,” was the
answer he received; and he dropped back on his
pillow as limply as if he had been overcome by a
great flash of truth.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, however, he heard a distant
commotion on the stairway and, after an instant
of whispering and murmuring in the hall,
his door flew open. To his astonishment, Bonnie
May literally ran into the room.</p>

<p>Her face was colorless; she was staring at him.</p>

<p>“What happened?” she asked in a voice which
was unsteady.</p>

<p>“Nothing, child!” he exclaimed sharply.
“They’ve alarmed you. It was nothing at all.
Didn’t mother tell you?”</p>

<p>“She told me there had been an accident and
that you were in bed. I didn’t wait for any more.”</p>

<p>“But you can see it’s nothing. I can’t understand
your being so excited.”</p>

<p>She went closer to him, and he could see that her
body was quivering. “Is it something that wouldn’t
have happened if I hadn’t gone away?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing at all—and it would have happened
in any case. I’ve only sprained my ankle.
I’m ashamed to mention such a little thing. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
for goodness’ sake, don’t look as if I’d had my
head cut off and you were to blame.”</p>

<p>She sat down a distance from his bed, a strangely
unhappy little creature. Her sharp uneasiness gave
place to a dull, increasing apathy. She was not
looking at Baron now.</p>

<p>He couldn’t stand that. “Did you see the play
last night?” he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>She stared at him. “Did I see it? Certainly
not. How could I?”</p>

<p>She was studying his eyes, and swiftly the misery
in her own was multiplied many times.</p>

<p>He almost lost patience with her. “Well, good
gracious! Don’t take it so much to heart. There
will be other chances. It made good, you know.
It will have a run sometime. We’ll see it, you and
I together.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, and sighed. A settled look of
misery returned to her eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She did not leave the mansion for many days.
Her sprightly moods returned to her occasionally;
yet it was not to be ignored that in some strange
fashion she was changed.</p>

<p>She spent much of her time in Baron’s room.
She became almost irritatingly eager to serve him.
She seemed to be wishing to atone for something—to
re-establish herself in her own confidence and respect.
That was how it seemed to Baron, after he
had observed her studiously a score of times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Occasionally he drove her from his room, achieving
this by gay upbraidings. He insisted upon
having the daily lessons attended to, and it was
with the liveliest interest that he listened to the
little tinkling melodies she played, slowly and with
many an error. He realized that a great deal of
progress was being made. His mother was patient,
and Bonnie May was a painstaking pupil.</p>

<p>Baggot came in in the course of a day or two.
He was cultivating a new sort of manner, in which
there was much condescension. His tone seemed
to say: “You see, I succeeded, even if you <i>did</i> fail
me.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure the play is going to be a winner,” said
Baron.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—it will go all right. I’m overhauling
it a bit. We only gave it that first performance
so I could see just how to finish it, and to get our
copyright, and that sort of thing. It will go on
regularly, you know, this fall.”</p>

<p>Baggot had received his promotion, Baron reflected.
He would go forward now into a more
active life. He would probably be seen at the
mansion a time or two again, and that would be the
end of him, so far as the Barons were concerned.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Another visitor during those days was the beer-driver,
who came to inquire about Baron’s condition,
and for further manifestations of kindness,
as it appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>Baron tried to shake his hand, but the task was
too herculean.</p>

<p>“I might go out the back way and slip in a can,
if the old lady’s against it,” he said, flushing readily
and smiling.</p>

<p>“It just happens that I don’t care for it,” said
Baron. “I’m quite as much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>He thought it was rather a hopeful sign that he
was genuinely pleased to see this man, who had
tried to be a good neighbor.</p>

<p>“August is my name,” said the visitor as he
prepared to go. “When you’re near the brewery,
ask for me. You could go to a dance with me some
night. We got a lot of fine fellows. Girls, too.”
He said this in the tone of one who would say:
“You’re plenty good enough to go with me.”</p>

<p>Then he, too, was gone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The days passed—more days than Baron liked
to count. And still Bonnie May did not go over
to the Thornburgs’, but haunted Baron’s room
early and late, between lesson hours, and tried in
a thousand ways to serve him.</p>

<p>He made curious discoveries touching her.</p>

<p>Often she stood by the window looking out, and
he marvelled to see her body become possessed by
some strange spirit within her. Her very flesh
seemed to be thinking, to be trying to become
articulate. And when she looked at him, after such
a period as this, she suddenly, shrank within herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
and gazed at him with a wistfulness so intense
that he felt an eager wish to help her—yet also a
strange helplessness.</p>

<p>Once he cried: “You strange little creature, what
is it?”</p>

<p>But she only shook her head slowly and whispered,
“Nothing”—though he saw that her eyes
filled with tears.</p>

<p>Finally Doctor Percivald called again—three
weeks had passed since the patient had been put
to bed—and announced that if Baron would confine
his activities to the house for a few days longer,
he might safely get up.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>BONNIE MAY SEES TWO FACES AT A WINDOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was at luncheon, and Baron was down-stairs
for the first time since his accident.</p>

<p>“It’s just like having Johnny come back from the
war,” observed Bonnie May, as the family took
their places at table. Baron, Sr., was not there.
He usually spent his midday hour at his club.</p>

<p>“From the war?—Johnny?” replied Baron. He
stood by his chair an instant, putting most of his
weight on one foot.</p>

<p>“I mean, you can think of so many delicious
things. We might believe you were wounded, you
know, coming home to see your wife and daughter.
As if the sentries had allowed you to come in for
a little while. They would be outside now, watching.
Men with dirty faces and heavy boots.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if I had a wife and daughter,” suggested
Baron.</p>

<p>“Oh, well—Flora and I. Anyway, you’ve got
a mother, and that’s the real thing when there’s
any soldier business.”</p>

<p>“It’s a real thing, anyway,” observed Mrs. Baron.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” admitted the child. She sighed
deeply. How was any one to get anywhere, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
so many literal-minded people about? She remembered
the man in the play who said, “If we
are discovered, we are lost,” and the other who
replied, “No, if we are discovered, we are found.”</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Baron who returned to prosaic affairs.</p>

<p>“I’m going out this afternoon,” she said briskly.
“I’ve been tied up here in the house three Thursdays.
There are people I simply must call on.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May did not know why her heart should
have jumped at this announcement. Still, there
seemed to be no end to the possibilities for enjoyment
in a big house when there wasn’t anybody
to be saying continuously: “You must,” or “You
mustn’t.”</p>

<p>She wandered up-stairs as soon as luncheon was
over, and in Baron’s room she was overcome by
an irresistible impulse.</p>

<p>She heard the houseman moving about in the
next room, and the thought occurred to her that
she had never seen the houseman’s room. She had
never even spoken to the houseman. There was
something quite mysterious about the fact that he
always kept to himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shepard had assured her on one occasion
that Thomason never had a word to say to anybody—that
he was a perverse and sullen creature.</p>

<p>Now it occurred to her that possibly Mrs.
Shepard’s estimate might lack fairness. Anyway,
it would be interesting to find out for herself. It
would be a kind of adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>She tapped lightly on Thomason’s door.</p>

<p>After an interval of silence, during which one
might have thought that the room itself was amazed,
there was the sound of heavy feet approaching.</p>

<p>The door opened and Thomason stood on the
threshold. Bonnie May had never been near
enough to him really to see him before. Now she
discovered that he had quaint creases about his
mouth and eyes, and that his eyes were like violets.
It was as if you had dropped some violets accidentally,
and they had fallen in a strange place. There
was a childish expression in Thomason’s eyes, and
it occurred to Bonnie May that possibly he was
afraid of people.</p>

<p>It seemed to her quite shocking that the little
man should remain by himself always, because he
was afraid of mingling with people.</p>

<p>Thomason’s eyes were very bright as he looked
at her. Then he winked slowly, to facilitate
thought. He was thinking: “She’s the one who
does whatever she pleases.” Despite his habits of
seclusion, Thomason was by no means oblivious
to the life that went on in the mansion.</p>

<p>“May I come in?” asked Bonnie May. She did
not worry about the absence of a spontaneous welcome.
“It’s an adventure,” she was thinking.</p>

<p>Thomason laboriously turned about, with a
slight list to leeward, and ambled to the middle of
the room, where he sat down on a bench. He took
up a pair of steel-rimmed glasses from which one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
temple had been broken and replaced by a piece
of twine. He slipped the twine over his head and
adjusted the glasses on his nose. It seemed necessary
for him to sit quite still to keep this contrivance
in place. When he reached around to his
bed for a coat, which he had evidently been mending,
he held his head and body as rigid as possible.</p>

<p>Bonnie May advanced into the room, her hands
clasped before her, her eyes quite freely surveying
her surroundings.</p>

<p>“What a quaint setting!” she observed.</p>

<p>Thomason jerked his needle through a tough
place and pulled it out to arm’s length, holding his
head with painful sedateness, on account of the
glasses. He seemed afraid to glance to left or right.
He made no reply at all.</p>

<p>“I’ve been learning to use a needle, too,” she
confided, thinking that he did not do it very skilfully.</p>

<p>Thomason held his head as far back as possible
and closed one eye. He was thus handicapping
himself, it appeared, in order to get a better view
of the work he held on his knee.</p>

<p>“Would you like me to hold it, while you go
across the room to look?” she asked.</p>

<p>Thomason suddenly became quite rigid. It was
as if his works had run down. He was thinking
about what Bonnie May had said.</p>

<p>Then, “Women!” he muttered, and the works
seemed to have been wound up again.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_fp292">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">Thomason jerked his needle through a tough place and pulled it out to arm’s length.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>This seemed a somewhat indefinite and meagre
return for so much cheerful effort, and Bonnie May
decided not to try any more just then. She went
to the gable window and looked out. She was
almost on a level with the fourth story of the building
next door, which had been remodelled for use
as a boarding-house. And looking up into the
window nearest her, she suddenly became animated
in the most extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>A man was looking down at her, and in his eyes
there was a puzzled expression to match the puzzled
expression in her own.</p>

<p>She turned, with subdued excitement, to Thomason,
sitting on his bench near the middle of the
room, with his bed and an old trunk for a shabby
background. If he would only go away!</p>

<p>She looked up at the man in the window opposite
and smiled. In a guarded tone she remarked:
“It’s a very nice day!” and instantly she turned
toward Thomason again, so that he might believe
she was addressing him in the event of his looking
up from his work.</p>

<p>But Thomason, believing this needless remark
had been addressed to him, had borne enough. He
arose laboriously, grasping his coat in one hand
and his spectacles in the other, and left the room.
At the door there was a muttered “Women!”—and
then a bang.</p>

<p>Bonnie May clasped her hands in delighted relief
and drew closer to the window. “It’s Clifton!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
she exclaimed to the man in the window opposite.</p>

<p>“It’s Bonnie May!” came back the eager response.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she moaned. She smiled up at the man
across the open space helplessly. Then she took
her left hand into her right hand, and shook it
affectionately.</p>

<p>“You dear thing!” came back the word from
Clifton. “Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Oh, why can’t I get at you?” was Bonnie May’s
rejoinder, and she looked down at the ground and
shuddered at the abysmal depths.</p>

<p>The man she had called Clifton disappeared for
a moment, and when he stood at the window again
there was some one close beside him, looking out
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“And Jack, too!” she breathed eagerly, yet
fearfully. It occurred to her that some one must
hear her, and drag her back into the tedious realm
of conventionality again. For the moment she
was almost inclined to regard herself as a kidnapped
person, held apart from friends and rescuers.</p>

<p>“If it isn’t the kid!” was the comment of the
second man, and his eyes beamed happily.</p>

<p>“You both rooming over there?” asked Bonnie
May.</p>

<p>“Since yesterday. We’ve got an engagement
at the Folly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“And to think of your being within—oh, I can’t
talk to you this way! I must get to you!”</p>

<p>“You and Miss Barry stopping there?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, I’m not working just now. Miss
Barry——”</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly, her eyes filling with terror.
She had heard a step behind her.</p>

<p>Turning, she beheld Baron in the doorway.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard you talking,” he said, in
quite a casual tone. “Was Thomason here?”</p>

<p>“I was talking—to Thomason. My back was
turned. He seems to have gone out.” She looked
about the room, even under the bed. She didn’t
want Baron to see her eyes for a moment. “Such
a quaint old gentleman—isn’t he?” she commented.
She had moved away from the window. She had
almost regained her composure now.</p>

<p>Baron’s brows contracted. He glanced toward
the window at which she had been standing. In
the depths of the room beyond he thought he could
detect a movement. He was not sure.</p>

<p>“Do you and Thomason talk to each other—quite
a little?” he asked. He tried to make his
tone lightly inconsequential.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t express it, so far as he is concerned.
He won’t talk to me at all. I have to do
all the talking.”</p>

<p>“And do you—feel quite confidential toward him?”</p>

<p>“Why, I think you might feel safe in talking to
him. He doesn’t seem the sort that carries tales.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>Baron went to the window and looked out. He
could see nobody. But when he confronted her
again his expression was harsh, there was an angry
light in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Bonnie May, you were talking to some one in
the other house. You were mentioning Miss Barry.
You weren’t talking to Thomason at all.”</p>

<p>She became perfectly still. She was now looking
at him steadily. “I was talking to Thomason until
he went out,” she said. “Then, as you say, I was
‘talking to some one in the other house.’ Why?
Why not?”</p>

<p>The docility of the home life, the eagerness to
be pliant and sweet, fell from her wholly. An old
influence had been brought to bear upon her, and
she was now Bonnie May the actress again. For
the moment benefits and obligations were forgot,
and the old freedom was remembered.</p>

<p>“We don’t know the people in that house,” retorted
Baron.</p>

<p>“That isn’t my fault. I happen to know two of
them. If you like I’ll introduce you. Very clever
people.” Her tone was almost flippant.</p>

<p>Baron was astounded. “You’ve found friends!”
he said. He couldn’t help speaking with a slight
sneer.</p>

<p>“You don’t do it very well,” she said. “I could
show you how, if you cared to learn—though it’s
rather out of date.”</p>

<p>“Bonnie May!” he cried reproachfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“You made me do it!” she said, suddenly forlorn
and regretful. “I didn’t do anything. That’s
a rooming-house over there, and I happened to see
two old friends of mine at the window. They were
glad to see me, and I was glad to see them. That’s
all.” Her expression darkened with discouragement.
She added: “And I wasn’t quite untruthful.
I <i>had</i> been talking to Thomason.”</p>

<p>Baron meditatively plucked his lower lip between
his finger and thumb. “I was wrong,” he
said. “I admit, I was in the wrong.” He tried
to relieve the situation by being facetious. “You
know I’ve been an invalid,” he reminded her.
“And people are always patient with invalids.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she said. And he had the disquieting
realization that she had grown quite
apart from him, for the moment at least, and that
it didn’t matter to her very much now whether he
was disagreeable or not.</p>

<p>She sighed and walked absent-mindedly from the
room. She remembered to turn in the doorway
and smile at him amiably. But he felt that the
action was polite, rather than spontaneous.</p>

<p>And he reflected, after she had gone away, that
she hadn’t volunteered to say a word about the
people she had talked to through the window.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>A GATHERING IN THE ATTIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Bonnie May went down-stairs and learned
that Mrs. Baron had gone out calling, she entered
her own room and pushed her door partly shut,
so that she would be invisible to any one passing.</p>

<p>Her most earnest wish, for the moment, was to
see her two friends next door. Of course, she would
see them before long, but she did not like to leave
the matter to chance.</p>

<p>There was no reason why she should not simply
go to their front door, and knock and ask for them.
No reason; but undoubtedly a prejudice. The
Barons wouldn’t approve of such a thing. She
really hadn’t been aware of the existence of the
house next door until now. She realized that there
were worlds between the people who lived over
there and the people who lived in the mansion.
So far as she was concerned, the Barons were a
Family, while Heaven only knew what those other
people were.</p>

<p>Well, she would think of some way of getting at
Clifton and Jack some other time. Something
would happen. And in the meantime, Mrs. Baron
was gone and there were various things which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
might be done now which couldn’t be done at any
other time.</p>

<p>Rummaging among her possessions in search of
an inspiration she came upon a hat covered with
little silk butterflies.</p>

<p>She had the liveliest appreciation of the silk
butterflies, though she did not quite approve of
the shape of the hat upon which they were bestowed.
On the other hand, there was a hat of
adorable shape which had an insufficient decoration
in the form of a spray of roses which were not
of the right color, and which were in too advanced
a stage of development.</p>

<p>In another moment a small pair of scissors was
travelling over one of the hats with a snipping
sound and a startlingly destructive effect.</p>

<p>The snipping was not suspended until voices,
subdued and confidential, arose in the near-by
sitting-room.</p>

<p>Baron had come down-stairs, too, and was talking
to Flora.</p>

<p>“The thing for us to do,” Baron was saying, “is
to go places, and let him know about it beforehand.
Any place at all. For a walk in the park, or to the
theatre. I wouldn’t be in the way. I would know
what to do. And after—that is to say, when....
What I mean is that in the course of time you could
just tell mother that you’ve made up your mind,
and that it’s your business, and not hers. The
thing is absurd. She’s got no reasons. We’ve no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
right to let her have her own way entirely in such
a case.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May dropped the hat into her lap, and
paid no attention to the shower of butterflies and
roses which fell to the carpet. Quite stealthily she
went out into the hall. A moment of indecision—and
then she descended the stairs to the first
floor.</p>

<p>“There’s <i>that</i> to be attended to, too,” she was
reflecting.</p>

<p>She went to the telephone immediately. She
had noiselessly closed the dining-room door, so she
wouldn’t be heard. And after very little delay she
had Mr. Addis on the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>“It’s Bonnie May,” she said in response to
Addis’s greeting. “I called you up to tell you that
you’re wanted here this afternoon. It’s really important.
I think, honestly, you ought to come.
Can you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, certainly!” came back the vigorous
and pleasant voice of Addis. “Yes, I’ll come right
away.”</p>

<p>In the hall she paused, thrilled by the contemplation
of a good, forbidden deed. Then the warm
sunlight, finding its way in through the ground-glass
door, enticed her, and she went out into the
vestibule. There she stood looking out on the
street.</p>

<p>Clearly, fate was on her side.</p>

<p>Almost immediately two immaculately dressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
gentlemen, moving with superb elegance, passed
the gate.</p>

<p>Bonnie May ran down the steps, calling to them.
“Clifton!” was the word that penetrated the chaos
of street noises, and “Oh, Jack!”</p>

<p>The two gentlemen turned about, and at the
sight of the child they became far less correct in
their general deportment. Happiness made them
quite unconscious of self.</p>

<p>Very shortly afterward a little girl was sitting
between two altogether presentable gentlemen on
the top step in front of the Baron mansion.</p>

<p>“Of course we shouldn’t,” admitted Bonnie May.
“We never sit on the front steps. I mean, the
Family. But nobody will know. And, besides, I
don’t see how we can help ourselves.”</p>

<p>“We don’t mind at all,” Clifton assured her.
He looked inquiringly over his shoulder, into the
vestibule. “What is it?—an old ladies’ home?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. It’s one old lady’s home, and you
couldn’t get in without a jimmy or a letter of introduction.
She used to be a Boone.”</p>

<p>“Of course that explains it,” said Clifton.
“What are you doing here? Does she give private
theatricals?”</p>

<p>“Not intentionally. No, I’m the little daughter
of the house—a kind of Little Eva, without any
dogs or fiddles, and I have to go to bed at nine
o’clock, and take lessons. It’s really a wonderful
place. When we all sit down to the table it—it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
sticks. When I get across with anything neat nobody
whistles. Far from it.”</p>

<p>Clifton and Jack accepted all this as quite definitely
informative.</p>

<p>“Domesticated,” explained Clifton to Jack, who
nodded.</p>

<p>“How did you find them?” Jack wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“They found me. There’s a Romeo in the house
who’s the real thing. Love me, love my Romeo.
That’s how I feel about him. He brought me here.”</p>

<p>“But where——”</p>

<p>“You see, Miss Barry wished me onto one of the
theatres here last spring when the going got rough.
Put me down and disappeared. And he found me.
I wish to goodness you and he could get acquainted.
<i>You</i> know that I was a baby only a few years back.
But just because I don’t cry for bread and milk
here they seem to think I’m Mrs. Tom Thumb
come back to earth. You could tell them.”</p>

<p>Clifton and Jack leaned back as far as they
safely could and laughed heartily. Then they
drew painfully sedate faces and sprang to their
feet. A soft yet decisive voice—the voice of a
young woman—sounded behind them.</p>

<p>When Bonnie May turned around she realized
that she and her two friends were standing in a
line on the bottom step, looking up into the faces
of Baron and Flora, who had made their appearance
in the vestibule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>Flora was smiling in a pleasantly mischievous
manner. Baron was regarding the two actors critically,
yet not with unfriendliness.</p>

<p>“Won’t you introduce your friends?” asked
Flora.</p>

<p>Bonnie May did so. She concluded with, “old
friends of mine in the profession.”</p>

<p>“If I might suggest,” said Flora, “it’s ever so
much more comfortable in the house, if you don’t
mind coming in.” She turned to Baron with slightly
heightened color. Her glance seemed to say: “You
can see they are gentlemen.” Something of constraint
passed from her eyes when Baron pushed
the door open and turned to the two men, who were
“in the profession,” and led the way into the house.</p>

<p>“Delighted,” said Clifton, mounting the steps,
followed by the other actor.</p>

<p>“You’re very welcome on your own account,”
said Baron, “and, besides, we all like to do anything
we can to please Mrs. Tom Thumb.”</p>

<p>He glanced sharply at Bonnie May, who nodded
in her best manner and remarked, with delicacy of
intonation: “Caught with the goods!”</p>

<p>The little joke paved the way for really comfortable
intercourse, and there was a highly satisfactory
condition of sociability in the sitting-room
up-stairs half an hour later when the street bell
rang.</p>

<p>It rang as if it were in the nature of a challenge.
And the ring was almost immediately repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“Mrs. Shepard must be out,” said Flora. She
went to respond.</p>

<p>It was only the McKelvey girls, after all. Bonnie
May heard their gay voices in the lower hall.
And it occurred to her that there was danger of
certain complications—complications which might
not be wholly agreeable.</p>

<p>She turned to Baron. “You know we’ve a hundred
things to talk about—old times and old friends.
Couldn’t we go up into your room until the company
goes?” She referred to herself and the actors,
of course.</p>

<p>In his heart Baron could have blessed her for the
thought. The McKelvey girls were on their way
up-stairs, and he was not sure about the propriety
of bringing the McKelvey girls into even a fleeting
relationship with two actors whom none of them
knew.</p>

<p>“Why, if you like,” he said, with an air of reluctance—which
he fully overcame by the promptness
with which he arose and got the child and her
friends started on their way.</p>

<p>Flora might have decided to entertain her callers
in the room down-stairs, if she had had any choice
in the matter. But the McKelvey girls had always
felt wholly at home in the mansion, and they had
begun climbing the stairs before Flora closed the
street door.</p>

<p>Flora paused for an instant, changing from one
arm to the other the huge bundle of flowers the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
elder Miss McKelvey had thrust at her upon entering.
A wan, resigned smile trembled on her
lips, and then she tossed her head ever so slightly.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the difference!” she exclaimed to
herself, and then she followed the others up the
broad flight of stairs.</p>

<p>Still, she was somewhat relieved to find no one
but her brother in the room into which the visitors
led the way. She did not know just what had happened,
but she did not ask any questions. And
then she heard the murmur of voices up in the
attic, and understood.</p>

<p>She brought a vase and put the flowers into it.
“Don’t they look beautiful?” she asked. She had
to lift her voice a little, because both of the McKelvey
girls were talking at once.</p>

<p>“They certainly do!” came the response in a
wholly unexpected voice, and Flora turned and
beheld the animated face of Mrs. Harrod, framed
in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Shepard asked me to come on up,” said
Mrs. Harrod. She looked about her as if the room
were empty. “Flora,” she demanded, “where’s
that child?” She had laid eager hands upon Flora’s
shoulders and kissed her flushed cheek with genuine
affection. She had also taken a second to glance
at the McKelvey girls and say: “How-do, young
ladies?”</p>

<p>“Child?” echoed Miss Baron.</p>

<p>“That perfect little creature, who was here the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
last time I was. I did hope she’d let me in again.
Such angelic manners! You don’t mean to say
you’ve let her go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bonnie May! No, she hasn’t gone. She’s
quite one of us now. Where is she, Victor?”</p>

<p>Baron fidgeted. “She went up into the attic, I
believe.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrod made for the hall immediately.
“I’m sure you don’t mind,” she said, without
turning around. They heard her climbing the
second flight of stairs. “You young people won’t
miss me,” she called back.</p>

<p>The younger Miss McKelvey suddenly sat up
very straight. “What’s the matter with you,
Flora Baron?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“The matter?”</p>

<p>“The way you’re looking at Victor—yes, and the
way he’s looking at you. What’s the mystery?”</p>

<p>Flora listened. Up-stairs a door opened and shut,
and then there was silence. “I was wondering if
Mrs. Harrod would find things just to her liking
up there,” she explained.</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, if she doesn’t, it will be her own
fault. People who take possession of a house can’t
be too particular.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” admitted Flora thoughtfully.
She was listening intently again. There was a
movement down-stairs. Mrs. Shepard was serenely
complaining to herself on the ground of many interruptions.
The street door opened and shut and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
Flora heard resonant, familiar tones. Baron heard
them, too.</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” Mrs. Shepard was heard to say, and
then there was the sound of her heavy tread on the
stairs.</p>

<p>Again Flora and Victor looked at each other
dubiously.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> the matter with you?” demanded Miss
McKelvey—the other Miss McKelvey, this time.</p>

<p>Flora leaned back against the mantel almost
limply and laughed—not the laugh of Bonnie May’s
lessons, but the old contralto gurgle. “Nothing,”
she said. Her cheeks flamed, her eyes were filled
with a soft light.</p>

<p>“Mr. Addis has called to see Miss Baron,” announced
Mrs. Shepard truculently in the doorway.</p>

<p>“I’ll go right down,” said Flora.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the elder Miss McKelvey.</p>

<p>“Oh!” echoed her sister.</p>

<p>They arose as by a common impulse and stole
out into the hall. “We don’t care if we do,” they
flung back in a whisper as they tiptoed to the
stair railing. They came hurrying back with ecstatic
twitterings. “You know you never entertain
company in that dark room down-stairs, Flora
Baron! You’ve got to bring him up!”</p>

<p>Flora gazed at them in rebellious misery.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” exclaimed the younger Miss McKelvey,
seizing her sister’s hand, “we’ll go up into
the attic!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>And they were gone.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Flora hopelessly, “it shows what
one criminal act will lead to!”</p>

<p>“There was no criminal act,” retorted Baron.
“Nothing is really wrong. Have him up!” His
tone seemed to say: “Assert your right! I’ll back
you up!”</p>

<p>He went to the head of the stairway. “Come
right up, Addis,” he called. He tried to throw a
great deal of cordiality into his voice.</p>

<p>Flora’s hands went to her temples in a gesture
of despair. “You invited him here in mother’s
absence—you know you did!” she cried.</p>

<p>“I didn’t. But I wouldn’t care if I had. I’d
have done it if I’d had the wit to think of it. Why
shouldn’t he come?”</p>

<p>“I won’t have him come in this way. Until
mother—” She slipped from the room without
finishing her sentence.</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do?” demanded
Baron.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing to do. I think I may
be needed elsewhere just now. I’m going up into
the attic.”</p>

<p>But as she made her escape she glanced down
the stairs. Somebody was coming up. There was
the stubborn black hair, the ruddy cheeks, and the
close-cropped black mustache——</p>

<p>But she was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Addis mounted the stairs with the determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
of one who goes more than half-way to meet
destiny.</p>

<p>“Come in!” called Baron. “Excuse me for not
coming to meet you. You know I’ve got a bad
ankle.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Addis, whose robust presence
somehow had the effect of making all the aspects
of the room effeminate and trivial. “You—were
expecting me?”</p>

<p>“No—that is,” bungled Baron, “we’re delighted
to have you call.”</p>

<p>Addis reflected. “And Miss Baron?” he asked.</p>

<p>“She’s up in the attic just now. There are some
callers, I believe.”</p>

<p>A dull flush mounted to the visitor’s forehead.
“I’m afraid I made a mistake,” he said. He arose,
casting a keen glance at Baron.</p>

<p>“You didn’t. You didn’t make any mistake at
all. We won’t wait for them to come down. Come,
let’s follow, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Follow—” said Addis.</p>

<p>“We’ll go up to the attic.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ATTIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Bonnie May got up into the attic she gave
one swift thought to the fact that Mr. Addis would
be coming to the house before long, and that she
would not be free to receive him. Flora would be
surprised to see him; but then, she concluded,
Flora ought to think all the more highly of him if
she decided that he had come without waiting for
an invitation.</p>

<p>Then her mind was diverted from Mr. Addis and
his affairs. It was diverted by an impulse which
compelled her to put her arms swiftly about Clifton’s
neck, and Jack’s, and express again her joy
at seeing them.</p>

<p>“You dear boys!” she exclaimed, “it makes me
feel so good—and so bad—to see you again. Oh,
those old days!”</p>

<p>They all found chairs, and for a little time Bonnie
May leaned forward in hers, her shoulders
drooping, her eyes filled with yearning. Then she
aroused herself. “Do you remember the time we
went to Cheyenne in a sort of coach, and the soldiers
made us have dinner—a Christmas dinner—with
them?” she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>Clifton remembered. He said: “And you put
on a cap that came way down over your eyes, and
ran into the fat old captain who had come in ‘unbeknownst,’
as one of the soldiers said, to inspect
the quarters!”</p>

<p>Said Bonnie May: “And the soldiers wanted us
to change our play, ‘The Captain’s Daughter,’ so
that it would be a military play instead of a sea
story!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then, for no
apparent reason, the child and her visitors joined
in a chorus of laughter.</p>

<p>“That old play—I remember every word of the
heroine’s part!” said Bonnie May. “She wasn’t
much, was she? I remember wishing I was big
enough to have the part instead of her.”</p>

<p>She shook her head gently in the ecstasy of recalling
the old atmosphere, the old ambitions, the
old adventures. Then she clasped her hands and
exclaimed: “Let’s do an act of it, just for fun!
Oh, let’s do! If you could only think how hungry
I’ve been——”</p>

<p>She did not wait for an answer. She hurried to
Thomason’s door and knocked. Her movements
expressed a very frenzy of desire—of need. When
Thomason did not respond she opened his door, and
looked into his room.</p>

<p>“He’s not here!” she exclaimed. “Come—his
things will make the grandest sailors out of you!”
She had them in Thomason’s room in no time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“But we can’t both be sailors,” objected Jack.
“We’ll need a captain.”</p>

<p>“We’ll imagine him. He’ll be out of sight somewhere.”
She opened Thomason’s trunk.</p>

<p>“It’s not—Romeo’s, is it?” asked Clifton dubiously.</p>

<p>Bonnie May only emitted a little scream of delight.
She had caught sight of two red bandanna
handkerchiefs. She had them out swiftly. Also
a new canvas coat, and an old one.</p>

<p>Then she heard some one entering the room.
Thomason came and stood beside her, to see what
she was doing. He looked into the trunk as if he
were curious to see what was in it.</p>

<p>Her manner betrayed no confusion at all. “So
glad you’ve come!” she said. “It’s going to be a
play. Oh, the very thing! You can be one of the
sailors, Thomason, and then we can have the captain,
too.” She appealed to Clifton and Jack.
“Won’t he make a perfectly splendid sailor?” she
demanded.</p>

<p>They agreed that he would be an ideal sailor.</p>

<p>Thomason hadn’t the slightest idea what it all
meant. But when she tied one of the red bandanna
handkerchiefs in a special fashion around the neck
of one of the actors, he concluded that it was going
to be some kind of a game. Or possibly he feared
he was going to lose his handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>“Put one on me!” he suggested.</p>

<p>And Bonnie May put one on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>Then she happened to look at one of the window-shades.
“Earrings!” she exclaimed. “They used
to look so delightfully wicked!”</p>

<p>With Clifton’s aid she removed several brass
rings from the window-shades.</p>

<p>“I won’t need them,” said Clifton. “You know
I was the captain.”</p>

<p>So the rings were hung in Jack’s ears and Thomason’s.</p>

<p>“Splendid!” cried Bonnie May. She inspected
the result critically. “If we only had— Thomason,
is there any blacking?”</p>

<p>Thomason found a box of blacking in Baron’s
room.</p>

<p>She dipped her finger into it and drew a series
of sinister lines across Jack’s unlined face.</p>

<p>Clifton proffered a criticism. “You’re putting
on too much. He’s to be a sailor—not a pirate.”</p>

<p>“No, only a sailor. But he ought to look a little
frightful.” She stood back in admiration of her
work.</p>

<p>Thomason had begun more clearly to understand.
“Put some on me,” he invited.</p>

<p>Clifton, in the meantime, had found a golf cap
which had been handed down from Baron to Thomason.
It did not make a thoroughly realistic captain
of him, but it was the best he could do. He was
trying to recall some of the telling phrases in “The
Captain’s Daughter.” He could improvise, if
necessary. He looked on seriously while Bonnie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
May put the finishing touches on Thomason’s
face.</p>

<p>It was then that Mrs. Harrod appeared.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m sure I’m intruding!” she cried. She
looked with profound amazement at every face in
the room.</p>

<p>“You’re not intruding at all!” declared Bonnie
May. “It’s to be a play, you know. You can be
the audience, if you will.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrod began to laugh almost helplessly.
Then she checked herself, because she perceived
that Bonnie May was deeply in earnest.</p>

<p>“Of course!” she responded. “I make a very
good audience. I’ll be delighted to help.”</p>

<p>She took a chair and became, immediately, a
highly inspiring audience. Still, she was amazed.
She had never been told by any of the Barons that
Bonnie May had formerly been “of the profession.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do only the third act,” decided Bonnie
May, addressing the two actors, “where the ship
sinks, and the raft is seen at sea.” She ended by
glancing at Mrs. Harrod, who nodded as if she
really preferred to witness only the third act.</p>

<p>“We’ll need a raft, of course,” she said. She
glanced about the room. The trunk was not large
enough to hold two and contribute to a realistic
effect. “It will have to be the bed,” she decided.
“Thomason, you and Jack will sit on the bed.
And you’ll have to remember that you’re on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
raft in a storm. The storm is so severe that you
nearly fall off the raft.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” asked Thomason. He seemed incredulous.</p>

<p>“It will be. Jack will let you know when. You
look at him once in a while and do just as he does.”</p>

<p>There was an explosion of shrill laughter in the
adjoining room, and then the McKelvey girls appeared.</p>

<p>They seemed quite startled and ready to run,
even after they saw Mrs. Harrod.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Harrod reassured them. “Come right
in,” she called cordially. “It’s to be a play, and
as yet we have a miserably small audience.”</p>

<p>They drifted a little farther into the room, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>It was here that Clifton rebelled. “Oh, look
here,” he protested, “it will look so silly!”</p>

<p>“Just because we have an audience!” retorted
Bonnie May blankly. Then, with feeling: “If
you’ve got used to playing to empty seats, it will
do you good to have somebody looking at you.
Now, do be sensible.”</p>

<p>“I shall be awfully disappointed not to see the
play—that is, the third act,” protested Mrs. Harrod.</p>

<p>“Well, go ahead,” said Clifton. But he looked
decidedly shamefaced.</p>

<p>Bonnie May took her position in the middle of
the room. She meant to explain what it was they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
were about to do. She did not know that Flora
had come in and was standing just inside the door;
nor did she know that Victor and Mr. Addis also
arrived a moment later.</p>

<p>“This is the situation,” she began. “I am the
daughter of the captain of a sailing vessel. Two
of the sailors love me, but they have to keep still
about it, because I am so far above them. We’re
all on the ship, on a voyage, you understand. I
love <i>one</i> of the sailors, but I’m afraid to admit it
for fear my father will be angry. Then one of the
sailors speaks to my father—about his love for me,
you know. But my father tells him he must never
be guilty of such boldness again. Then the two
sailors lead a mutiny, in the hope of getting control
of the ship. But the mutiny fails, and the two
leaders are put in irons.</p>

<p>“I feel so sorry for them that I plan their escape.
I know I cannot marry either of them, but I pity
them just the same. So I take some of the rest of
the crew into my confidence, and they make a
raft in secret. Then one night when we are within
sight of land I get the other sailors to let them
go—the two men who are in irons—and throw them
overboard, together with the raft. I mean it all
for their own good, though they make the mistake
of thinking I wish to have them murdered.
Of course, my father isn’t allowed to know anything
about all this. It’s done while he is asleep.”</p>

<p>“A likely story!” interpolated Clifton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“A very fine situation,” amended Bonnie May.
“It is arranged that the sailors who have helped
me are to tell my father, when he wakes up, that
the two prisoners made their escape and were trying
to murder him, when they, the other sailors,
threw them overboard in a desperate fight.</p>

<p>“Then comes the third act, which we are about
to present. A storm comes up and the ship strikes
a rock. We are about to sink when the raft drifts
into sight. The two sailors who were prisoners are
on it. My father urges me to join the sailors on the
raft, so that I may be saved. But I know they
believe I plotted their murder, and I am as much
afraid of them as I am of the sinking ship. The
climax comes when the ship sinks and I am thrown
into the sea. Of course the two sailors rescue me.
Now we will imagine that the curtain has just gone
up on the third act.”</p>

<p>She turned for an inspection of the “company,”
and caught sight of Flora, Victor, and Mr. Addis
just inside the doorway.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind us,” said Flora. “We hope we’re
not interrupting.”</p>

<p>But Bonnie May was not to be embarrassed now.
She scarcely took pains to answer beyond a swift—“Not
at all!” She was earnestly shaping her mood
for the work ahead of her.</p>

<p>Her intensity had created a really strange atmosphere.
Nothing louder than a whisper could be
heard in the room, and even whispering soon ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“Now, captain—or father—take your place on
the bridge, where you belong.”</p>

<p>Clifton proceeded with the utmost seriousness to
climb up on Thomason’s table. He stood at one end,
so that there would be room for Bonnie May also.</p>

<p>“The sailors will now take their places on the
raft,” was the next order. “You know, you’re
not supposed to be visible until you hear the line,
‘the ship is sinking,’ and then you want to remember
that you are in a violent storm.”</p>

<p>Jack and Thomason climbed to the middle of
the bed and sat down awkwardly, both looking in
the same direction, like rowers in a boat.</p>

<p>“And remember you have paddles in your hands,”
reminded Bonnie May.</p>

<p>“I have a paddle,” responded Jack.</p>

<p>“I ain’t,” objected Thomason.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you have,” declared Jack, “one just
like mine.” He took a stroke with an imaginary
paddle, held suitably.</p>

<p>“Well—I have a paddle,” conceded Thomason.</p>

<p>Bonnie May then was helped to the “bridge,”
beside Clifton.</p>

<p>Clifton began. He was not quite sure about the
lines, but he recalled the situation clearly enough.
“Best go below, my daughter,” were the words
which filled the room with a ringing effect. “I
have not seen a gull since the second watch ended,
and they do not hide from ordinary storms. I
fear we may be caught in a tempest.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_fp318">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_fp318.jpg" alt="Look at them!">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“Look at them!” she screamed. “Look! Look!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>Bonnie May clasped her hands in a frenzy of
earnestness. Her words came with intense eloquence:
“Let me stay with you, father. I fear
no storm while I am by your side.”</p>

<p>Her voice filled the room with tones which were
intense, even, resonant, golden.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrod, regarding her incredulously, put
out a hand and touched Flora on the arm. No
one else stirred.</p>

<p>There came Clifton’s response: “But, child, I
tell you Davy Jones’s locker fairly gapes in gales
like this. I bid you go below.”</p>

<p>The response came with even greater intensity:
“But tell me first, father: Would a raft live in such
a sea as this?”</p>

<p>So the rather silly lines were repeated, back and
forth. But they scarcely seemed silly. The two
players were putting a tremendous earnestness into
them, and the “audience” felt no inclination at all
to smile.</p>

<p>The two players came to the point in the story
where the ship struck a rock, and their intensity
was more than doubled. The raft began its part
in the scene, but nobody looked at it for a time.</p>

<p>Clifton was trying to compel Bonnie May to
consent to board the raft. He had seized her arm
roughly and was threatening her. She screamed
her refusal. Then it came time for her to behold
the murderous looks on the faces of the two men on
the raft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>“Look at them!” she screamed. “Look!
Look!” She pointed at the raft, her eyes wide
with terror. The “audience” could not refrain
from looking at the raft.</p>

<p>Jack and Thomason were wielding their paddles
with great vigor. Jack had also begun to lurch
from right to left, as a man might do in a storm-tossed
raft. Thomason, catching the drift of things,
was imitating him.</p>

<p>And then, unfortunately, Thomason’s bed gave
way. With an ear-splitting crash it collapsed, just
as Bonnie May screamed: “Look! Look!”</p>

<p>And of course it was at that precise instant that
Mrs. Baron came rushing into the room.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>AFTER THE CURTAIN WAS LOWERED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Baron</span> had returned from her calling expedition
earlier than she had expected to. She had had
a feeling that something might go wrong. Prescience
is really a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>Now as the poor lady stood within Thomason’s
room she was quite terrified. For the moment there
had been a dreadful din. And now, looking at
Thomason, she caught the rebellious expression in
his round, innocent eyes. She saw that he had
brass rings in his ears. Unfortunately she did not
associate the brass rings with the window blinds.
And his face was horribly streaked. His right leg
was sticking up in air quite inelegantly, and he
was clawing at some other unspeakable person in
an effort to regain his equilibrium.</p>

<p>And then there was Bonnie May, with an insane
light in her eyes. And behind Bonnie May was a
smirking creature who grinned maliciously at Mrs.
Baron, as if he and she shared some guilty secret
in common. Certainly she did not know the man.</p>

<p>Moreover, there stood Flora, looking unspeakably
demure, with the man Addis by her side.
Addis was looking as if her arrival had provoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
him. His look seemed to say: “If you don’t like
it, why don’t you run along?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron did not stop to take in any of the
others. At first she was speechless, as the saying
is, though she was trying to shape certain comments
which she meant to direct at Bonnie May.</p>

<p>She opened her mouth once and again quite
helplessly. Then she found her voice.</p>

<p>“You little—limb of Satan!” The words came
with difficulty. In that instant her features looked
quite unlovely. Bonnie May might have told her
that elderly people ought never, under any circumstances,
to become violently angry. But Bonnie
May was in no condition to utter elemental
truths.</p>

<p>“You awful little—wretch!” added Mrs. Baron.
“No sooner do I turn my back than you disgrace
me! You open my door to—the whole street!”</p>

<p>Bonnie May was blinking rapidly. She was very
pale. If you dreamed that you were finding large
sums of money, and some one threw a bucket of
cold water on you, and you woke up to find yourself
in the poorhouse—that perhaps fairly describes her
mental state.</p>

<p>She had not been quite sorry that the bed collapsed.
Some of the secondary cells in her brain
had been warning her, as she stood on the “bridge,”
that the third act could scarcely be made to come
to a true climax. She couldn’t be projected into
the sea really. She would have to step tamely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
down from the table and begin to talk in a commonplace
fashion.</p>

<p>Under favorable conditions the collapse of the
bed would have been a relief.</p>

<p>But now she stood looking at Mrs. Baron trying
to reach her soul through her angry eyes. She
shrank so from being humiliated before her friends—the
old and the new. If Mrs. Baron, who had
been so kind in many unimportant ways and times,
could only spare her now!</p>

<p>“If you will permit me, madam—” began Clifton.</p>

<p>“Who are these—gentlemen?” demanded Mrs.
Baron, still wrathfully regarding Bonnie May—Bonnie
May and no other.</p>

<p>“They are my friends,” said Bonnie May. “They
have known me always. And really, you know,
we weren’t doing anything wrong!”</p>

<p>Clifton had assisted her to the floor; and now,
after an appealing step in Mrs. Baron’s direction,
and the swift conclusion that nothing she could do
would save the situation, she broke into tears and
staggered from the room.</p>

<p>“Bonnie May!” called Clifton, with overflowing
solace in his tone. He ran after Bonnie May. The
other actor, casting brass rings and red bandanna
to the floor, followed.</p>

<p>“Emily Boone!” The voice was Mrs. Harrod’s.
“I think you might blame us, if it’s all so terrible.
We encouraged her. We <i>enjoyed</i> it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>Mrs. Baron now turned toward the assembled
group. She seemed dazed. “I—I didn’t know
you were here!” she said, her voice trembling
weakly. And then—“I don’t care! What would
any woman do, coming home and finding strangers
and—and such a scene in her house?”</p>

<p>“We invited them in, mother,” confessed Baron
weakly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” echoed Flora, “they were old companions
of Bonnie May’s, and we thought it would be nice
to invite them in!”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you invited—<i>him</i> in, too?”
retaliated Mrs. Baron, indicating Addis by a scornful,
slight movement of her head.</p>

<p>The effect of this upon Flora was most distressing.
Could her mother so far forget herself as to
reveal family differences in the presence of Mrs.
Harrod and the McKelvey girls? Her wounded
eyes fairly begged for mercy.</p>

<p>Addis promptly came to her relief.</p>

<p>“No, she didn’t, Mrs. Baron. I just dropped
in.” His voice, by reason of its bigness and calmness,
had the effect of making every one in the
room feel how petty and needless had been the
unpleasantness which Mrs. Baron’s arrival had
created. His hair seemed more bristling than ever
as he added: “If you will permit me, I’ll bid you
good day.” He made a rather stiff bow, which
was meant to include every one in the room, and
turned to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>But here Mrs. Harrod interfered again. “Peter!”
she called.</p>

<p>The uttering of the unfamiliar given name created
profound surprise in certain minds.</p>

<p>“Peter!” she repeated. “I won’t have you go
away like that. I want you to know Mrs. Baron
better than you seem to know her. She doesn’t
mean half she says. Emily, tell him I’m right!”
She looked commandingly at Mrs. Baron. It was
evident that she had a nature which was not to be
subdued by trivial mishaps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron flinched. “Who is Peter?” she demanded
feebly.</p>

<p>“If you don’t know, I advise you to cultivate
your son’s friends. Do you mean that you don’t
know Peter Addis? Why, he’s been like a son of
mine. You ought to have known how fond I and
the colonel are of him. I’m surprised you’ve never
met him at our house.”</p>

<p>“I never did,” said Mrs. Baron, swallowing with
difficulty.</p>

<p>“Well, for goodness’ sake let’s go down-stairs—please
excuse me for suggesting, Emily, in your
house—and behave ourselves. I suppose we’ve
all been at fault—all except that delightful child.
I’m going to find her and tell her so!”</p>

<p>“It was so funny!” declared the elder Miss
McKelvey, appealing tremulously to Mrs. Baron,
and patting her on the arm. She thought of laughing,
which was, she believed, the easiest thing to
do in all sorts of circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>Mrs. Harrod’s brain was working energetically.
She had been reading various faces, and she realized
that even yet Mrs. Baron had not spoken to Addis.
She drew conclusions. On the way down-stairs
she kept Addis close to her.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Peter,” she said, in large, cheerful
tones, “I think it’s downright shabby for you
to neglect us as you have been of late. I miss
those old evenings so!—when you and the colonel
used to come in from hunting, and sit down and
eat like two famished boys, and bring the atmosphere
of outdoors with you. Do you remember how the
dogs used to slip into the house, in spite of the
colonel’s scolding, and put their heads on your
knees while you ate supper? Those were the occasions
that made a home worth having.”</p>

<p>Addis, entirely satisfied with the turn affairs
were taking, responded eagerly: “I certainly do
remember. I’ve often wondered if the colonel had
Queenie yet. There was a dog for you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Queenie’s been dead over a year. It’s
Prince and Hector, now—Queenie’s puppies. The
colonel says they’re every bit as smart as their
mother was. I wish you’d come out soon. On a
Sunday, if you’d rather find us alone. We’ll sit
out under the grape-arbor. You know the grapes
are just getting ripe. Those little vines have grown
up beautifully. The colonel always has his bottle
of what-do-you-call-it out there, and his pipe, and
I send the servants away and prepare a little
lunch——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>They were in the sitting-room now, too eagerly
engaged in their conversation to think of sitting
down, and Mrs. Baron was waiting humbly to regain
control of the situation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrod was not unmindful of her old friend’s
discomfort; but she had an idea she was engaged in
giving a patient a dose of medicine, and that she
ought to be careful that none of it was spilled.</p>

<p>“If you’ll excuse me,” said Mrs. Baron, now
thoroughly dejected, “I’ll look for Bonnie May.
I think I ought to have a talk with her.”</p>

<p>She had heard every word that Mrs. Harrod had
spoken to Mr. Addis. And she had heard enough.</p>

<p>She went to Bonnie May’s room. She was too
confused to realize that Flora accompanied her.
But as she stood staring miserably into the empty
room she heard Flora’s comforting voice.</p>

<p>“She’s probably down-stairs, mother, with—with
her friends.”</p>

<p>Flora went to the stairway and called. There
was no response. She listened, anxiously turning
her eyes toward her mother; but there was no
sound of voices on the floor below.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t have remained in the house a
minute,” declared Mrs. Baron, who was now frankly
remorseful.</p>

<p>“But Bonnie May—she may have gone back to
talk to Mrs. Shepard,” suggested Flora. They
could hear Mrs. Harrod’s voice, pleasantly masterful.
She had introduced Addis to the McKelvey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
girls, now that she happened to think of it, and
they were slipping eager gusts of laughter and disconnected
phrases into the conversation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron and Flora went down-stairs and appealed
to Mrs. Shepard.</p>

<p>Bonnie May had gone out, Mrs. Shepard said.
She had come down-stairs and telephoned something
in great haste, and then she had induced her two
gentleman friends to go away. An automobile had
come quite promptly, and she had gone away in it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron turned away from her daughter and
rested her hand against the wall at the foot of the
staircase. Her attitude spelled repentance and
fear.</p>

<p>She went up into the child’s room, and Flora
followed close enough to hear a low, tremulous cry
of despair.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, mother!” soothed Flora, whose
eager voice brought Mrs. Harrod and the others.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baron was standing beside a little worktable
and a chair that were Bonnie May’s. Her
face was quivering. “I’m a disagreeable old creature,”
she declared. “I don’t deserve to have any
happiness.”</p>

<p>One hand fumbled with a handkerchief, which
she lifted to her eyes. From the other, slowly relaxing,
a handful of roses and ridiculous little silk
butterflies fluttered slowly to the floor.</p>

<p>“I want you all to leave me—please!” she
begged. “I’m not fit to be seen.” She put forth a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
hand to Mrs. Harrod. “Do come back again soon,”
she begged. “And you, too,” she added, extending
her hand to the McKelvey girls. And then, as
she dabbed her discolored eyes, she concluded with—“And
you, too!” She glanced aside, but her hand
went out to Addis.</p>

<p>Then she disappeared into her own room, and
softly closed the door.</p>

<p>Flora’s eyes were shining as she escorted the
party down-stairs. “She’s only gone to visit
friends,” she declared. “She’ll be back.”</p>

<p>The McKelvey girls burst from the front door
ahead of the others. They were cheerful creatures
who were not to be depressed long by the scenes
they had just witnessed.</p>

<p>Flora, standing in the hall to let the others pass,
heard them shrieking joyously: “Oh, what a lovely
new car you’ve got, Mrs. Harrod,” and then she
heard Mrs. Harrod explaining, as she emerged into
the sunlight: “A birthday present from the colonel.”</p>

<p>They had all passed out now except Addis, and
when Flora opened the door a little wider for him
he stood still an instant and looked out. The others
were out there inspecting Mrs. Harrod’s new car.</p>

<p>Then he took Flora’s hand in his and closed the
door firmly and securely.</p>

<p>It was fully a minute before the door was opened
again, and Addis descended the steps alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrod and the McKelvey girls forgot the
new machine immediately. They were all looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
at Peter Addis. And they were all thinking precisely
the same thing, namely, that they had never
in all their lives seen a man who looked more extraordinarily
handsome and happy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>THE MANSION IN SHADOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Bonnie May did not return to the mansion
that night the fact was not commented upon by
any member of the family. It was not quite remarkable
that she should spend the night with the
Thornburgs. That was where she had gone, of
course.</p>

<p>It is true that Mrs. Baron was decidedly uncomfortable.
The rupture that had occurred was more
serious than any that had preceded it. Possibly
she had gone too far. There was the possibility
that Bonnie May might nurse a very proper grievance
and decide that it was pleasanter to live with
the Thornburgs than to continue her residence at
the mansion.</p>

<p>In brief, she might refuse to come back. That
was Mrs. Baron’s fear. It was a fear which hurt
the more because she was unwilling to speak of it.</p>

<p>However, when the next day passed and night
came, Baron took no trouble to conceal his anxiety—for
still Bonnie May had not returned.</p>

<p>He called up the Thornburgs by telephone.
Was Bonnie May there? He asked the question
very affably. Yes, came back the reply—in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
equally affable tone—she was there. Would he
like to speak to her?</p>

<p>No, she need not be troubled; he merely wished
to be sure she was there.</p>

<p>Baron believed, without expressing his belief to
any one, that it would be a mistake to manifest
anxiety about the late guest—or probably the
temporarily absent guest. So it came about that
one day followed another, and Bonnie May did
not come back, and the several members of the
family pretended that nothing was specially wrong.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Baron who first thrust aside a wholly
transparent pretense.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble with that Thornburg arrangement,”
she said at dinner one day, apropos
of nothing that had been said, but rather of what
everybody was thinking. “I don’t blame her for
being offended; but if the Thornburgs were not
making efforts to keep her she’d have been back
before now. On the whole, we were really very
good to her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shouldn’t worry,” declared Baron briskly.
“She’ll be back. If she doesn’t come before long
I’ll go over there and—and tole her back.”</p>

<p>A second week passed—and she had not returned.
And now her absence was making a distinct
difference in the mansion. The dinner and
sitting-room conversations became listless; or during
the course of them a tendency toward irritability
was developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>One day Mrs. Baron sought her son alone in his
attic. Said she: “Do you suppose she’s not coming
back at <i>all</i>?” She looked quite wan and bereft
as she asked the question.</p>

<p>Baron felt remorseful. “Of course she is,” he
assured her. “I’m going over to the Thornburgs’.
I’m going to see about it.”</p>

<p>Bonnie May was acting foolishly, he thought.
The Thornburgs were not keeping faith. Yet it
was a difficult matter for him to make a clear case
against either Bonnie May or the Thornburgs, and
he was by no means comforted by a little event
which transpired one morning.</p>

<p>He encountered the two actors as he was leaving
the mansion, and his impulse was to speak to them
cordially. But in returning his greeting they manifested
a well-simulated faint surprise, as if they
felt sure Baron had made a mistake. They nodded
politely and vaguely and passed on.</p>

<p>In his mind Baron charged them angrily with
being miserable cads, and he was the more angry
because they had snubbed him in such an irreproachable
fashion.</p>

<p>Even Baron, Sr., became impatient over the long
absence of Bonnie May. Realizing that his usual
practise of watching and listening was not to be
effective in the present instance, he leaned back in
his chair at dinner one evening and asked blandly:
“What’s become of the little girl?”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Baron made a flat failure of her effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
to be indifferent. Her hand trembled as she adjusted
her knife and fork on her plate. “Why, I
don’t know,” said she. “You know, she has two
homes.” But she was afraid to attempt to look
anywhere but at her plate.</p>

<p>Baron was astounded by the utter dejection
which his mother tried to conceal. Why, she loved
the child—really. She was grieving for her.</p>

<p>And that evening he emerged from the house
with much grimness of manner and made for the
Thornburgs’.</p>

<p>The dusk had fallen when he reached the quiet
street on which the manager lived. Street-lamps
cast their light among the trees at intervals. In
the distance a group of children were playing on
the pavement. Before the Thornburg home silence
reigned, and no one was visible.</p>

<p>Yet as Baron neared the approach to the house
he paused abruptly. He had been mistaken in
believing there was no one near. In the heavy
shadow of a maple-tree some one was standing—a
woman. She was gazing at the lower windows of
the Thornburg residence. And there was something
in her bearing which seemed covert, surreptitious.</p>

<p>He, too, looked toward those windows. There
was nothing there beyond a frankly cheerful interior.
He could see no one.</p>

<p>What was the woman looking at? He glanced
at her again, and a bough, swaying in the breeze,
moved from its place so that the rays from a near-by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
lamp shone upon the figure which appeared to
be standing on guard.</p>

<p>She was overdressed, Baron thought. Under
an immense velvet hat weighted down with plumes
masses of blond hair were visible. Her high, prominent
cheek-bones were not at all in keeping with
the girlish bloom which had been imparted to her
cheeks by a too obvious artifice. She had caught
up her skirt lightly in one hand, as if the attitude
were habitual, and one aggressively elegant shoe
was visible.</p>

<p>He had paused only momentarily. Now he proceeded
on his way, passing the woman in the shadow
with only half the width of the sidewalk between
her and him.</p>

<p>He had recognized her. She was the woman who
had stood in the theatre that night talking to Thornburg—who
had visited Thornburg in his office.
Could she be Miss Barry? Baron wondered.</p>

<p>A maid let him into the house and drew open a
sliding door, revealing the lighted but empty drawing-room.
She took his card and disappeared.</p>

<p>He sat for a time, counting the heavy minutes
and listening intently for sounds which did not
reach him. Then the manager and his wife entered
the room, both bending upon him strangely expectant
glances.</p>

<p>Baron arose. “I’ve taken the liberty—” he
began, but Thornburg instantly swept all formalities
aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>“That’s all right,” he said. “Keep your seat.”
Then, obviously, they waited for something which
they expected he had come to say.</p>

<p>But he was listening for the sound of Bonnie
May’s voice. He seemed almost absent-minded
to the man and woman who were intently regarding
him.</p>

<p>Then Thornburg, plainly afraid of offending his
guest by a too impulsive or impatient word, fell
back upon commonplaces. He concluded that he
must wait to hear what Baron had come to say.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard about Baggot’s good luck?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I think not,” replied Baron, not at all cordially.</p>

<p>“His play. They’re getting ready to put it on
in Chicago. His people have a theatre there that’s
not engaged just now. There’s to be an elegant
production—first-class people and everything. Baggot’s
gone on to look after the rehearsals. We
ought to have it here by the first of the year—or
earlier, if a number two company is organized.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t heard,” said Baron. “I haven’t seen
Baggot lately.” With intention he spoke listlessly.
Thornburg wasn’t coming to the point, and he didn’t
intend to be played like a fish.</p>

<p>An uncomfortable silence fell again, and again
Baron found himself listening intently.</p>

<p>And then he could bear the suspense no longer.
He leaned toward Thornburg with animation.
“Look here, Thornburg,” he said, “I don’t believe
you’re playing fair!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>“You might explain that,” responded the manager
curtly.</p>

<p>“You know what the agreement was. I don’t
believe she’d stay away like this unless she’d been
restrained.”</p>

<p>Thornburg’s only response was a perplexed frown.
It was Mrs. Thornburg who first took in the situation.
She arose, painfully agitated, and faced
Baron. “Do you mean that she isn’t at your
house?” she demanded. Her voice trailed away to
a whisper, for already she read the answer in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Baron sank back in his chair. “She hasn’t been
for weeks,” he replied.</p>

<p>Thornburg sprang to his feet so energetically
that the caller followed his example. “I thought
it was you who wasn’t playing fair,” he said. And
then he stared, amazed at the change in Baron’s
manner.</p>

<p>The younger man was rushing from the room.
There had come to him unbidden the picture of
the two actors who had snubbed him in front of
his house—a recollection of their studied aloofness,
their cold, skilful avoidance of an encounter with
him. They had taken her!</p>

<p>But at the door he paused. “But I telephoned
to you,” he said, remembering. “You told me she
was here.”</p>

<p>“She was here the day you telephoned. She
went away the next day.”</p>

<p>Baron frowned. “She went away—where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>“She went in the machine. Of course we supposed——”</p>

<p>Thornburg hurried to the telephone and was
speaking to his chauffeur, in a moment. “Oliver?
Come to the house a moment, Oliver—and hurry.”</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver and hurried back to
meet the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The soldierly appearing young chauffeur was
standing at attention before them in a moment.</p>

<p>“We want to know if you can remember where
you took Bonnie May the last time she left the
house.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, sir. She asked me to stop at the
Palace Theatre. She said she was expecting to
meet a friend there. And she told me I was not to
wait—that she wouldn’t need the car again that
afternoon.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Fifteen minutes later Baron was ringing the bell
of the house next to the mansion. He couldn’t
recall the two actors’ names, but he described them.
He wished to see them on urgent business.</p>

<p>But they had paid their bill and gone away.
The woman who met Baron at the door was sure
they had said something about finishing their engagement
at the Folly and about leaving the city.</p>

<p>As Baron turned away from the door it seemed
to him that the street had suddenly gone empty—that
the whole world was a haunted wilderness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>“THE BREAK OF DAY”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Victor Baron</span>, please.”</p>

<p>An usher with an absurdly severe uniform and
a frankly cherubic countenance had pushed aside
the hangings and stood looking into the Baron box
in the Barrymore Theatre.</p>

<p>It was the night of the first performance of Baggot’s
play, “The Break of Day,” in Thornburg’s
theatre, and the Barons were all present—by special
and urgent invitation.</p>

<p>Baron had been studying the aisles full of people,
eagerly seeking their seats, and listening to the continuous
murmur which arose all over the house.
But when he heard his name called he arose and
slipped out into the shadows.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thornburg sends his compliments and asks
if you’ll be good enough to visit him in his office
for a few minutes.” Thus the cherubic usher.</p>

<p>The Barrymore office was off from the lobby,
but it commanded a view not only of the street
but also of the procession of men and women who
passed the ticket-office.</p>

<p>Thornburg had left the door open, and Baron,
approaching, caught sight first of a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
expanse of dazzling white shirt-front and then of
the manager’s ruddy, smiling countenance. Evidences
of prosperity were all about. A procession
of motor-cars continued to stop before the theatre
to deposit passengers. Throughout the lobby
there was the shimmer of costly fabrics worn by
women, the flashing of jewels, the rising and falling
of gusts of laughter and a chaos of happy speech.
And everywhere there was the glitter of onyx panels
and pillars, and the warmth of hooded lights, and
the indefinable odor of fine raiment and many delicate
perfumes.</p>

<p>Thornburg seized Baron’s hand and shoved the
door to with his foot. Happiness radiated from
him. “I’ve a secret to tell you,” he began. “I
want you to be one of the first to know.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have it!” responded Baron, trying to
reflect a little of the manager’s gayety.</p>

<p>“You’ll remember my telling you that I had a
little daughter by my first wife?”</p>

<p>“I remember.”</p>

<p>“I’ve found her again!”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s fine!”</p>

<p>“And that isn’t all. You’re going to see her to-night.”</p>

<p>Baron waited.</p>

<p>“She’s the girl they’ve been making all that fuss
about in Chicago—who’s been known only as ‘The
Sprite.’ She’s got the leading part in ‘The Break
of Day.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>Baron felt his way cautiously. He couldn’t
mar such superb complacency, such complete happiness.
“And Mrs. Thornburg—” he began haltingly.</p>

<p>“God bless her, it’s all right with her. She knows,
and she’s as happy as I am.”</p>

<p>Baron shrunk back with a sense of utter loss.
“Thornburg,” he said, “I want you to tell me—is
the little girl the daughter of—of Miss Barry?”</p>

<p>The manager clapped a heavy hand on Baron’s
shoulder. “No,” he responded. And after a moment’s
almost pensive reflection he regained his
buoyant manner and resumed. “I’d like you to
meet her. Between acts, or after the play. You
and your family. She’s young. I think a little
attention, especially motherly attention, will mean
a lot to her just now. Of course she mustn’t be
worried to-night; but suppose we make up a little
party, after the performance, and make her feel
that she’s got friends here?”</p>

<p>Baron couldn’t think of refusing. “I’d have
time to pay my respects, at least,” he agreed. “And
I’ll put the case before my mother and the others,
just as you have stated it. I think perhaps she’ll
consent.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good fellow. I’ll be looking for you,”
concluded Thornburg, and then he joyously shoved
Baron out of the office.</p>

<p>The footlights were being turned on and the
asbestos curtain lifted as Baron returned to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
seat. Then the orchestra began to play, and under
cover of the music Thornburg’s secret and his invitation
were passed on to Mrs. Baron and to the
others in the box.</p>

<p>Baron did not catch his mother’s response, and
she did not repeat it. She had turned to listen to
the music. For the moment the orchestra was commanding
a good deal of attention. A cycle of popular
melodies was being played, and under the
spell of the singing violins the outside world was
being made to recede into the distance, while the
mimic world became real.</p>

<p>Men and women forgot that out on the winter
streets, only a few yards from them, there was
passing that disinterested throng which always
passes the door of every theatre; the eager, the listless,
the hopeful, the discouraged, and that sprinkling
of derelicts who have no present drama at all,
but who are bearing inevitably on toward the final
tragedy.</p>

<p>The orchestra completed the popular melodies;
and after a brief interval the leader rapped his
music-rack with his baton to enjoin attention.
Then he lifted his hand as if in benediction over a
player to his left, and a wood-wind instrument announced
a new theme—penetratingly, arrestingly.
Then the strains of “The Ride of the Valkyries,”
with their strident and compelling quality, filled
the theatre.</p>

<p>Baron was startled by the touch of a hand on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
his shoulder. Baggot was leaning toward him.
“That’s to create the right atmosphere,” he whispered,
nodding toward the orchestra. “It’s to put
the idea of the supernatural into everybody’s
mind, you know.” He withdrew then.</p>

<p>Baron thought that was just like Baggot—to be
explaining and asserting himself, as if he were
doing it all. He was glad to be rid of him. He
wanted to feel, not to think. Then he realized that
the musicians had laid aside their instruments and
that the curtain was being slowly lifted.</p>

<p>Applause greeted the setting. The stage represented
the heart of a forest in midsummer—“the
heart of the summer storms.” There was a shadowy
dell, shut in by a wilderness. One giant tree
in the foreground rose to invisible heights. At the
back a little stream trickled down over a mossy
bank, and during its course it formed a silent pool
in one silent place, and before this a Psyche innocently
regarded her face in the mirror of water.</p>

<p>Then the foliage of the big tree began to be
agitated by a rising storm, and the leaves shook
as if they were being beaten by descending drops.</p>

<p>For a moment the summer-shower effect continued.
Then from the highest point on the stage
visible to the audience a character in the drama
appeared—the Sprite. She sprang from some unseen
point to the limb of the ancient tree. The
limb gave gently, and she sprang to the next limb
below. The secure platforms making this form of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
descent possible were hidden from the audience
by heavy foliage. The descent continued until
the fairy figure sprang lightly to the stage.</p>

<p>She was clad in a costume of leaves, the prevailing
color of which was a deep green, rising to natural
tints of yellow. She wore a hood which was cunningly
fashioned from one big leaf, around which
an automobile veil of the gauziest texture was
wound so that it concealed her face.</p>

<p>She began unwinding this veil as she spoke her
first lines.</p>

<p>“Back again where the storms are!” she was
saying: “Ah, it is good, after that dreadful calm.”</p>

<p>Baron realized that his mother had lifted her
hands to her bosom as if to stifle a cry. For himself,
a thrill shot through his body, and then he
leaned forward, rigid, amazed.</p>

<p>For when the Sprite had removed the last fold
of her veil and faced the audience he beheld again,
after long waiting and vain search, the lost guest,
Bonnie May.</p>

<p>She wore her hair in a little golden knot at the
crown of her head; the waist-line of her dress was
just below her arms, and a pair of tiny golden sandals
adorned her feet. When she would have lain
the veil aside a screen of leaves parted and a Titan
sprang to her side to render service.</p>

<p>And so the play began.</p>

<p>But for the moment Baron could not think about
the play. He was thinking of Baggot—Baggot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
who had known all the time. Then again he felt
a touch on his arm and, turning, he found himself
looking into the playwright’s eyes; and he could
perceive only the delight of a childish creature,
jubilant because he had achieved an innocent surprise.</p>

<p>He tried to respond with a smile—and could
not. But little by little the play caught his attention.
The impression grew upon him that “The
Break of Day” was a play of that indefinable
quality which goes unfailingly to the heart. But
more—he realized that Bonnie May was carrying
her audience with her with the ease and certainty
of an artist. She ceased to be on trial almost immediately,
and those who watched her began to feel
rather than to think, to accept rather than to
judge.</p>

<p>When the first intermission came Baron slipped
out of the box and went in search of Baggot, whom
he found standing apart in the foyer.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to tell you I’m glad,” he began;
and then, with furrowed brow, he added, “but
surely....”</p>

<p>Baggot read his thought accurately. “I wanted
to give you the surprise of your life! You can’t
help being pleased?”</p>

<p>“Pleased! Certainly! But we’ve been distressed
about her.”</p>

<p>“Oh—distressed! Well, she belongs to the
theatre. She always has. <i>I</i> saw that right away!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>“But if we’d only known! I don’t suppose we
could have stood in the way.”</p>

<p>“But it was her idea—at first. She didn’t want
you to know. I mean when we put the piece on
here for a try-out—at first.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean——”</p>

<p>“Of course! It was when you were laid up. I
thought she’d lay down on me, because you wouldn’t
see her that night. And then came the Chicago engagement.
I took my mother along to look after
her. I didn’t know she hadn’t told you anything
for a time, and then I left it to her to do what she
wanted to do. It was always her idea to take you
by surprise. I think she cared more for that than
for anything else. Great goodness, man, you don’t
imagine <i>you’ve</i> been treated badly?”</p>

<p>Baron’s glance became inscrutable.</p>

<p>“Why, just think of it!” Baggot went on.
“She’s drawing the salary of a regular star. And
her reputation is made.”</p>

<p>Baron turned away almost curtly. What was
to be gained by discussing Bonnie May with a
creature who could only think of salary and reputation—to
whom she was merely a puppet, skilled
in repeating lines of some one else’s fashioning?</p>

<p>He entered Thornburg’s office. His manner was
decidedly lugubrious.</p>

<p>The manager held out his hand expansively.
“You’ve come to congratulate me,” he said. And
then he took in Baron’s mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>“Oh, I see!” he went on. “There’s something
that needs explaining. I played fair with you all
right, Baron. You see, I was in the dark myself,
in some ways.”</p>

<p>He took occasion to light a cigar, which he puffed
at absent-mindedly. “Just before Bonnie May
showed up here—when you got hold of her—I
learned that her mother had died. It had been
kept from me. You see, I was sending the mother
money. And when the little one was only a year
or so old I got a letter from her mother offering to
give her up to me. I’ve told you what happened
then. I—I couldn’t take her. Then I got another
letter from the mother saying she was turning
Bonnie May over to her sister for the time being,
and that I was to send the remittances to her.
That was Miss Barry.</p>

<p>“I believed the arrangement was only temporary.
I didn’t understand it, of course. But when several
years went by I began to suspect that something
was wrong. I didn’t like Miss Barry. She was
never the woman her sister was. She was—well,
the brazen sort of woman. I wasn’t willing to leave
the little daughter with her any longer. I wrote
to her and told her she might send Bonnie May
to me, if she cared to, but that there weren’t to be
any more remittances. I thought that would fetch
her. I meant to put the little daughter in a home
or a school somewhere. And then they blew in
here, and you got her—and your getting her was
just the thing I wanted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>An incandescent light on the manager’s desk
winked once and again. “The curtain’s going up,”
he informed Baron, and the latter hurried back to
his seat.</p>

<p>As he entered the box a flood of cold air from the
stage swept over the audience. And when his
mother shivered slightly he observed that Peter
Addis, sitting immediately behind her, quietly
leaned forward and lifted a quilted satin wrap
from a chair, placing it deftly about her shoulders.</p>

<p>She yielded with a nestling movement and with
a backward flash of grateful recognition which
told a story of their own.</p>

<p>The audience was stilled again as the second
setting was revealed—“the home of the autumn
leaves.” Here was a masterpiece of designing and
painting, Baron realized. A house was being constructed
for the Sprite. Much disputation arose.
The sort of talk which precedes the planning of a
home was heard—save that the terms were
grotesquely altered. Then the action was complicated
by the arrival of a band of vikings, driven
ashore by a gale.</p>

<p>And then Baron, too, forgot that Bonnie May
was a human being, as Baggot seemed to have
done, and was lost in the ingenious whimsicality
of the play.</p>

<p>It was after the third act—in which there was a
picture of cruel winter, with all the characters in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
the play combating a common foe in the form of
the withering cold—that the Sprite won the heartiest
approval.</p>

<p>Thunders of applause swept over the house;
and when the effect of thunder had passed there
was a steady demonstration resembling the heavy
fall of rain. Again and again Bonnie May bowed
as the curtain was lifted and lowered, and again
and again the applause took on new vigor and
earnestness. And then she stepped a little forward
and nodded lightly toward some one back in the
wings, and the curtain remained up.</p>

<p>She made a little speech. It seemed she had a
special voice for that, too. It was lower, but elaborately
distinct. The very unconventionality of it
afforded a different kind of delight. Her manner
was one of mild disparagement of an inartistic
custom. She bowed herself from the stage with
infinite graciousness.</p>

<p>She was a tremendous success.</p>

<p>It was only after the curtain went down for the
last time that Thornburg appeared at the Baron
box. The scene had been called “Spring—and the
Fairies,” and it had put the pleasantest of thoughts
into the minds of the audience, which was now
noisily dispersing.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re all coming back on the stage for
a minute,” said the manager.</p>

<p>He was dismayed by Mrs. Baron’s impetuosity.
She was too eager to remain an instant talking to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
any one. She could scarcely wait to be escorted
back to the stage—and yet she had no idea how to
reach that unknown territory undirected. Her
bearing was really quite pathetic.</p>

<p>And in a moment the entire party had passed
through a doorway quite close to the box, and were
casting about in that region where the wings touch
the dressing-rooms. The players were hurrying to
and fro, and one man, carrying a large waxen nose
and a pair of enormous ears—he had been a gnome
in the play—paused and looked curiously at the
very circumspect intruders.</p>

<p>Somehow it did not seem at all remarkable to
Baron, as it might have done, that he presently
found himself confronting Miss Barry. It was
plain that she had been waiting to enter the child’s
dressing-room, and at the approach of Thornburg
she brightened—rather by intention, perhaps, than
spontaneously.</p>

<p>“Oh, how fortunate!” she began. “You’ll be
able to help me, of course. I want to see the new
star! I’d lost track of her.” Her practised smile
and shifting eyes played upon Thornburg menacingly,
inquiringly, appealingly. “I want to begin
planning for her again. When her engagement
here is over I mean to take her with me to the
coast. She’s reached an age now when I can be of
real help to her. Isn’t it wonderful—the way she
has developed?”</p>

<p>Thornburg had paused to hear her to the end.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
He realized that there was a pitiful lack of assurance—of
conviction—in her manner.</p>

<p>When she had finished he smiled tolerantly, yet
with unmistakable significance. “No, Miss Barry,”
he said, replying to her thought rather than her
words. “That’s all ended now. When Bonnie
May has finished her work here I shall see that she
has a home in her father’s house.”</p>

<p>The party moved into the dressing-room, where
Bonnie May had been robbed of her fairy trappings
and put into a modest frock. Her hair, released
from its little knot, was falling about her shoulders
and was being combed by a maid.</p>

<p>But she escaped from the maid—and for the
moment from all the life which the dressing-room
implied—when she saw Mrs. Baron standing in
her doorway.</p>

<p>She had put her arms about the trembling old
lady’s neck, and for the moment they were both
silent. And then Mrs. Baron drew back and stood
a moment, her hands framing Bonnie May’s face.</p>

<p>“You do forget that I was a disagreeable old
woman!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” came the warm response; “you
know you forget just little slips when you are happy
in your work. And I couldn’t have remembered
such a little thing anyway, when you’d been so
lovely to me!”</p>

<p>She took Mrs. Baron’s hand in both her own
and clung to it; and lifted it to her face and laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
her cheek against it. “If you only knew how I’ve
thought of you—of all of you—and longed for you!
And how much I wanted you to see me at work, so
you would—would <i>know</i> me better! You know
just talking doesn’t prove anything. I wanted so
much to have you know that I was an—an artist!”</p>

<p>In the theatre the orchestra was still playing
while the people filed out. In the distance there
was the muffled sound of the procession of motor-cars
starting and of announcers shouting numbers
above the din.</p>

<p>It was Flora’s turn to press forward and take
her seat beside Bonnie May now; and while Mrs.
Baron stood aside, smiling quite happily, the manager
spoke to her as if he were merely continuing
a conversation which had been interrupted.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m particularly anxious to have you go
on with—with the lessons, you know. Not just
the books and music, you understand, but—well,
say a general influence. You know, she’s tremendously
fond of all of you. I mean to get her off
the stage as soon as the run here is finished. It’s
time for her to have a little real life. And I’d like
things to go on about as they were—I mean, having
her in your house, or mine, just as she feels about
it. You were the first to give her a mother’s attention.
I’d be grateful if you felt you could go on
with that.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">She had put her arms about the trembling old lady’s neck,

</figure>

<p>Mrs. Baron tried to answer this quite punctiliously,
but she had to turn aside to hide her eyes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
and when she spoke her words were a surprise to
her.</p>

<p>“I think you’re a good man,” she said. And she
did not trust herself to say anything more. She
was gazing at Bonnie May again, and noticing how
the strange little creature was clinging to Flora’s
hand with both her own, and telling—with her
eyes illustrating the story gloriously—of the great
events which had transpired since that day when
the mansion went back to its normal condition of
loneliness and silence.</p>

<p>Baron was observing her, too. He had found
a chair quite outside the centre of the picture, and
he was trying to assume the pose of a casual onlooker.</p>

<p>But Bonnie May’s eyes met his after a time and
something of the radiance passed from her face.
She turned away from Flora and stood apart a
little and clasped her hands up nearly beneath her
chin, and her whole being seemed suddenly tremulous.
She was thinking of the home that had
been made for her, and of how it was Baron who
had opened its door. The others had been lovely,
but the ready faith and the willingness to stand
the brunt—these had been his.</p>

<p>She moved forward almost shyly until she stood
before him, and then her hands went out to him.</p>

<p>“I must offer my congratulations, too!” he said.</p>

<p>But she ignored that. “Do you remember a
time when we talked together about some words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
that we thought were beautiful—up in the attic?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“And you told me you didn’t think much of
‘aunt’ or ‘uncle,’ but that you liked ‘father’
and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was the time.”</p>

<p>“I remember perfectly.”</p>

<p>“You know, there’s another word I’ve thought
of since then that I’ve wished I could—could have
for my own.”</p>

<p>He seemed to be casting about for that other
word.</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely word, too....” She drew closer
to him. “Help me!” she pleaded, and when he
looked into her eyes, a bit startled, she whispered—“Brother
... brother!” Her hand was on his
shoulder, and then it slipped its way to his neck.</p>

<p>“Ah, that <i>is</i> a good word!” said Baron. And
then the tempest of affection broke, and she had
her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>He had no idea she was so strong. She was choking
him a bit. But no, it wasn’t really the strength
of her arms, after all, he realized.</p>

<p>And then, because his mother and Flora were
watching, and because—well, because he was Baron,
he straightened up and got possession of her hands
again. He patted them lightly.</p>

<p>“It is a good word,” he repeated. “It’s one that
has come to have a much bigger meaning for me
since I knew you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>“And you won’t think it’s got anything to do
with that silly old joke...?”</p>

<p>He was really perplexed.</p>

<p>“You know, when they say: ‘I’ll be a sister to
you!’” She was bubbling over with the old merriment
now. “Just to make you keep at a distance,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh—no, I’ll be sure it hasn’t anything to do
with that.”</p>

<p>He regarded her almost dreamily as she turned
again to his mother and Flora. He was thinking
of the amazing buoyancy, of the disconcerting,
almost estranging humor which lay always just
beneath the surface; of her fine courage; of the
ineradicable instinct which made everything a sort
of play. They would be hers always. Or would
there come a time when she would lose them? He
wondered.</p>

<p>“There is our number!” interrupted Peter Addis,
who had been listening to the voice of the announcers.
He had brought the party to the theatre
in his own car.</p>

<p>There was a reluctant movement toward the
theatre.</p>

<p>“... Oh, a matinée performance now and then,
if she likes,” Thornburg was explaining to Baron.
“But for a few years, at least, that will be all.
She’s going to have the things she’s had to go without
all her life.”</p>

<p>They followed the line of the wall around toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
the front exit. The orchestra had quit playing.
The time had come to extinguish the lights.</p>

<p>But after the others had gone Baron stood a
moment alone. He looked thoughtfully toward
the upper right-hand box.</p>

<p>“I thought she was lost that day,” he mused.
“I thought I was rescuing her. And now I know
she wasn’t really lost then. Not until afterward.
And now she has found her home again.”</p>
